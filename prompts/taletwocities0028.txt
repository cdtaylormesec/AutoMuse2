Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”  “Story!”  He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”  “Not of Beauvais?”  “Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.”  “At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”  “I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands. In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers
