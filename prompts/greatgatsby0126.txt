Story so far: The narrator is impressed by Gatsby's sensitivity and ability to connect with people, despite his own reservations about him. Tom and Gatsby are arguing about whether Gatsby actually went to Oxford. Daisy tries to intervene, but Tom is not interested in hearing what she has to say. Gatsby is content with the argument, because it means that they are finally out in the open. Jordan Baker tells the narrator that she is engaged to another man, and the narrator reflects on a conversation they had about driving. A man named Bill Biloxi stayed with the narrator's family for three weeks, until her father told him to leave. The day after he left, her father died.
