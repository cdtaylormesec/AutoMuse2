Story so far: The narrator, Nick, is reflecting on the events following Jay Gatsby's death. In particular, he focuses on Tom and Daisy's discussion of Gatsby's "old sport" expression, and how Daisy changing the subject to their own wedding in Louisville prompts Jordan to mention that someone fainted.

The passage also describes Catherine's determination to prove her sister's innocence, and how Wilson is reduced to a man deranged by grief. In the end, the narrator reflects on his responsibility for Gatsby's death.

At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.  I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.  “Left no address?”  “No.”  “Say when they’d be back?”  “No.”  “Any idea where they are? How
