Gatsby tells the narrator not to talk so much, and the narrator reflects on how Gatsby's happiness is based on an illusion. The passage also describes Catherine's determination to prove her sister's innocence, and how Wilson is reduced to a man deranged by grief. In the end, the narrator reflects on his responsibility for Gatsby's death. The passage describes a woman's reaction to the parties at Gatsby's house. She is appalled by the rowdiness and the lack of propriety, but is also intrigued by the people. The passage describes Jordan Baker's encounter with Gatsby, and reveals that Gatsby bought his house in West Egg specifically so that he would be across the bay from Daisy. The passage ends with the narrator reflecting on Gatsby's request that the narrator invite Daisy to his house. The passage describes how Rosy Rosenthal was shot and killed. It happened late at night, and the group of people he was with were still awake. They were sitting in a room, and when the waiter came to tell Rosy that someone wanted to speak to him outside, they pulled him back down into his chair and told him not to go. The person who shot him then left. This all happened around 4 in the morning.

Last chunk: night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.  “ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’  “It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”  “Did he go?” I asked innocently.  “Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”  “Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.  “Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”  The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:  “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”  “No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.  “This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”  “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”  A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around
