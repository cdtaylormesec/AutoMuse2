Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr√©monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. Mr. Lorry tries to remain positive, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on the revolutionaries. The passage also describes a doctor's experience treating a patient with a mental illness and a group of women who are mourning the death of a man named Foulon. The passage describes a meeting between the narrator and a woman who turns out to be the Marquis St. Evrmonde's wife. The woman is very upset and tells the narrator that she hopes to find and help her husband's younger sister. The narrator can only tell her that such a sister exists, but nothing more. The passage describes the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during the time of the Revolution. Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher are out buying groceries and wine when they encounter various groups of people, some of whom seem to be excited about something. They avoid these groups and eventually find what they're looking for. Mr. Cruncher has had a change of heart and is now hoping that his wife is "flopping" (engaging in some sort of illicit activity). Miss Pross is distressed but hopeful that Mrs. Cruncher is finding whatever she is doing to be satisfying. Lucie visits the prison where her husband is being held every day, regardless of the weather. Every day, she kisses the prison wall before leaving. Her husband sees her occasionally, and this is enough for her. In December, she arrives at the prison to find the city celebrating. The wood-sawyer's shop has a sign reading "Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!"

Last chunk: to his sawing again.  In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.  These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!  The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a
