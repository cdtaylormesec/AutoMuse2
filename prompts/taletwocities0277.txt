Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes Mr. Lorry's reaction to learning about the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. He is troubled by the news, but tries to remain positive and hopeful. Mr. Lorry and Monseigneur discuss the upcoming revolution in France. Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. Monseigneur, a powerful lord at Court, holds a reception in his grand hotel in Paris. He is served chocolate by four attendants, one of whom pours it out for him. Mr. Cruncher is angry with his wife because he thinks she has been deliberately sabotaging his attempts to make money. He tells her that he will not put up with it any longer. The Marquis de Saint-Euverte tells his nephew that he would rather die than see the property and France fall into his hands, because he knows he would not be able to take care of them. The nephew sadly agrees, saying that the property is not worth mentioning anyway. The Marquis then goes on to say that if the property did come into his nephew's hands, he would abandon it immediately. The woman in the passage is asking her husband to be kind to a man named Mr. Carton, who she believes is a good person despite his bad reputation.

Last chunk: one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?”  “Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?”  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!  “I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.”  “Indeed, my own? Why so?”  “That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.”  “If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?”  “I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”  “It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this of him.”  “My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.”  She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.  “And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”
