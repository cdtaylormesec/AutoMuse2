Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Last chunk: run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.  All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.
