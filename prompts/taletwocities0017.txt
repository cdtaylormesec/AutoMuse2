Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. Mr. Lorry tries to remain positive, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on the revolutionaries. The passage also describes a doctor's experience treating a patient with a mental illness and a group of women who are mourning the death of a man named Foulon. The passage describes a meeting between the narrator and a woman who turns out to be the Marquis St. Evrmonde's wife. The woman is very upset and tells the narrator that she hopes to find and help her husband's younger sister. The narrator can only tell her that such a sister exists, but nothing more. The passage describes the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during the time of the Revolution. Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher are out buying groceries and wine when they encounter various groups of people, some of whom seem to be excited about something. They avoid these groups and eventually find what they're looking for. Mr. Cruncher has had a change of heart and is now hoping that his wife is "flopping" (engaging in some sort of illicit activity). Miss Pross is distressed but hopeful that Mrs. Cruncher is finding whatever she is doing to be satisfying. Lucie visits the prison where her husband is being held every day, regardless of the weather. Every day, she kisses the prison wall before leaving. Her husband sees her occasionally, and this is enough for her. In December, she arrives at the prison to find the city celebrating. The wood-sawyer's shop has a sign reading "Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!" A man is on his way to dig someone out of a grave and he sees many faces of the person he is looking for, but he does not know which is the right one.

Last chunk: keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.  But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:  “Buried how long?”  The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”  “You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”  “Long ago.”  “You know that you are recalled to life?”  “They tell me so.”  “I hope you care to live?”  “I can’t say.”  “Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”  The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too
