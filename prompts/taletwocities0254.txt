Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.  She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.     CHAPTER XVIII. Nine Days   The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor’s room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.  “And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby!
