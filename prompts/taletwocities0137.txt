Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. Mr. Lorry tries to remain positive, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on the revolutionaries. The passage also describes a doctor's experience treating a patient with a mental illness and a group of women who are mourning the death of a man named Foulon. A corner in Soho is described, where church organs are made, and a group of people are playing a wine game in a Paris suburb when the wine is suddenly spilled. Young Jerry is pursued by a coffin throughout the night. A man known as Defarge is described as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It is not difficult to find his house. Carton dines at a place of refreshment and falls asleep. He wakes up refreshed and goes to Defarge's shop. There is no customer in the shop but Jacques Three. Carton orders a small measure of wine. Madame Defarge casts a careless glance at him. Monseigneur was a nobleman who believed that the world was made for his pleasure. He was out at a supper last night and was waited on by only three men. This made him realize that he had allied himself with a Farmer-General, who was not able to make anything of Monseigneur's finances.

Last chunk: ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.  Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.  Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”  Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently
