Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reaction of Mr. Lorry, a British man, to learning about the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. He is troubled by the news, but tries to remain positive and hopeful. Mr. Lorry and Monseigneur, a powerful lord at Court, discuss the upcoming revolution in France. Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. Monseigneur holds a reception in his grand hotel in Paris, during which Mr. Cruncher, a working class man, becomes angry with his wife for what he perceives to be her deliberate sabotaging of his attempts to make money. The Marquis de Saint-Euverte tells his nephew that he would rather die than see the property and France fall into his hands, because he knows he would not be able to take care of them. The nephew sadly agrees, saying that the property is not worth mentioning anyway. The woman in the passage is asking her husband to be kind to a man named Mr. Carton, who she believes is a good person despite his bad reputation. The passage also describes a village that has been ruined and its people are starving, criticizing the wealthy class that has caused this destruction. Finally, the passage describes the atmosphere in a courtroom during the French Revolution, where the accused, Charles Evrmonde (called Darnay), is on trial for being an enemy of the Republic. A carriage hits a child and the man who was hit by the carriage starts screaming. The people around him look at the Marquis with watchfulness.

Last chunk: children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.  But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.  “What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.  A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.  “Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is a child.”  “Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”  “Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”  The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.  “Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”  The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and
