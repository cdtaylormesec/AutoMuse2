Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The passage describes the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. It notes that even though the events of the Revolution were horrific, they were ultimately overseen by forces of nature that are indifferent to human suffering. A figure scolds the inn servants for not fetching things and orders them to bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar. The figure tenderly cares for the patient, calling her "my precious" and "my bird." The figure is angry with Mr. Lorry, accusing him of frightening the patient.

Last chunk: gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.  “And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; “couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call _that_ being a Banker?”  Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.  “I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.  “No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”  “I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”  “A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?”  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.
