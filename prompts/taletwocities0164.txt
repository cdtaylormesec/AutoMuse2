Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes Mr. Lorry's reaction to learning about the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. He is troubled by the news, but tries to remain positive and hopeful. Mr. Lorry and Monseigneur discuss the upcoming revolution in France. Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. Monseigneur, a powerful lord at Court, holds a reception in his grand hotel in Paris. He is served chocolate by four attendants, one of whom pours it out for him. Mr. Cruncher is angry with his wife because he thinks she has been deliberately sabotaging his attempts to make money. He tells her that he will not put up with it any longer. The Marquis de Saint-Euverte tells his nephew that he would rather die than see the property and France fall into his hands, because he knows he would not be able to take care of them. The nephew sadly agrees, saying that the property is not worth mentioning anyway. The Marquis then goes on to say that if the property did come into his nephew's hands, he would abandon it immediately.

Last chunk: as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,  “My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.”  When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.  “Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.”  “This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I renounce them.”  “Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”  “I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed to me from you, to-morrow--”  “Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”  “--or twenty years hence--”  “You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that supposition.”  “--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”  “Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.  “To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.”  “Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.  “If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified
