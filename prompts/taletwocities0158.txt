Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: Young Jerry sees his father and two other fishermen sneak through a gate into a blind lane. He follows them and they all crouch down, perhaps listening for something. Mr. Lorry grows concerned when Dr. Manette falls silent and withdraws into himself, and does his best to engage the doctor in conversation. When this fails, he begins to worry that Dr. Manette is slipping back into madness. Time passes slowly, and Mr. Lorry's hope dwindles as the days go by. The passage describes a bride on her wedding day, with her father and bridesmaid. The bride is happy, but remembers her brother who should have been the groom. The passage describes a staircase in a old, crowded building in Paris. The staircase is filthy and dangerous, and the narrator notes that it would be difficult for someone to climb it. The passage describes Mr. Lorry's reaction to learning about the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. He is troubled by the news, but tries to remain positive and hopeful. The Marquis de Saint Evremonde asks his servant about the noise he hears outside, and the servant tells him it is his nephew, Charles Darnay. The Marquis tells the servant to tell Darnay that supper is ready and he is welcome. Darnay says he has come from London and the Marquis comments on how long it took him to arrive.

Last chunk: he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.  “Monseigneur? That?”  “Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”  It was done.  “Well?”  “Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here.”  The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions.  “Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”  That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the chateau.  “Ask who is arrived.”  It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.  He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.  Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands.  “You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.  “Yesterday. And you?”  “I come direct.”  “From London?”  “Yes.”  “You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a
