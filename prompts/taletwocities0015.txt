Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The novel tells the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of several different characters. Some of the characters are on the side of the revolution, while others are against it. The novel shows the different ways that people react to the violence and chaos of the revolution. A gentleman of sixty is sitting in a coffee-room, waiting for his breakfast. He is well-dressed and looks orderly and methodical. He is a little vain of his good leg, and his clothes are of a fine texture. The rider on horseback is a mystery to the other passengers in the coach, just as they are mysteries to him. He has eyes that seem to be hiding something, and he is very secretive. He stops at ale-houses along the way to drink, but he is careful to keep his muffler over his face.

Last chunk: evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.  “No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. “It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don’t think he’d been a drinking!”  His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.  While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at
