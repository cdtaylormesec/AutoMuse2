Tom and Wilson are talking about selling Tom's car. Wilson is sick and needs money, and he and his wife want to move West. A man from Minnesota arrives in town after receiving a telegram that Mr. Gatsby has died. He is revealed to be Gatsby's father, and he is very upset. The passage describes Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps at a party, looking around at the guests. The narrator notes that Gatsby does not seem to be enjoying himself, and that he does not interact with the other guests. Suddenly, Gatsby's butler appears and tells the narrator that Gatsby would like to speak to the narrator's companion, Miss Baker, alone.

A well-dressed black man interjects and says he saw the car that did it. Wilson, who was in the office with the victim when she was hit, starts yelling and Tom has to hold him back.
