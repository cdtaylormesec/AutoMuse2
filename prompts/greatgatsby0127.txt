Story so far: The narrator is impressed by Gatsby's sensitivity and ability to connect with people, despite his own reservations about him. Tom and Gatsby are arguing about whether Gatsby actually went to Oxford. Daisy tries to intervene, but Tom is not interested in hearing what she has to say. Gatsby is content with the argument, because it means that they are finally out in the open. Jordan Baker tells the narrator that she is engaged to another man, and the narrator reflects on a conversation they had about driving. A man named Bill Biloxi stayed with the narrator's family for three weeks, until her father told him to leave. The day after he left, her father died. The narrator later remarked to her husband that Biloxi was from Memphis, and he gave her an aluminum putter that she still uses.

The day after he left Daddy died.”  After a moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”  “I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.  “That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”  The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.  “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”  “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”  “Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”  “He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”  “Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”  Jordan smiled.  “He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”  Tom and I looked at each other blankly.  “Biloxi?”  “First place, we didn’t have any president—”  Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.  “By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”  “Not exactly.”  “Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”  “Yes—I went there.”
