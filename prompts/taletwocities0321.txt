Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evrémonde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.

Story so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. Mr. Lorry tries to remain positive, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on the revolutionaries. The passage also describes a doctor's experience treating a patient with a mental illness and a group of women who are mourning the death of a man named Foulon. Monsieur the Marquis arrives at his estate, which is composed entirely of stone. He enters the dark, silent house and is led by a flambeau-bearer to his destination. Stryver tells a group of people that a man will never find someone as good as the person he is talking about and that he always runs away. Lorry then asks Darnay to take charge of a letter and to explain to the recipient that the letter was meant for them. Darnay agrees and starts to leave but is stopped by Stryver.

No, gentlemen; he’ll always show ’em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”  With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank.  “Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. “You know where to deliver it?”  “I do.”  “Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?”  “I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”  “From here, at eight.”  “I will come back, to see you off.”  Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents:   “Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.  “June 21, 1792. “MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.  “After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed
