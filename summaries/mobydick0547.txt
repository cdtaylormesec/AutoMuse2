The author reflects on how the sense of touch is concentrated in a whale's tail and how this delicacy is especially evident in the way the whale sweeps its tail from side to side. The author also muses on how it would be useful if the whale's tail was prehensile and had the ability to grab things, like an elephant's trunk.
