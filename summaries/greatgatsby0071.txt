The passage describes how Rosy Rosenthal was shot and killed. It happened late at night, and the group of people he was with were still awake. They were sitting in a room, and when the waiter came to tell Rosy that someone wanted to speak to him outside, they pulled him back down into his chair and told him not to go. The person who shot him then left. This all happened around 4 in the morning.
