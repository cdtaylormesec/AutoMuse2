The passage describes a person finding an old document in a graveyard. The document is a commission from Governor Shirley to Jonathan Pue, appointing him Surveyor of Customs in Salem. The person remembers reading about Pue's death and the digging up of his remains, and notes that only a skeleton and some fragments of clothing were all that remained of him.
