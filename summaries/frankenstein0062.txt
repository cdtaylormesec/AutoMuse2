The speaker has been so deeply engaged in one occupation that they have not allowed themselves sufficient rest, and they are now hoping that all their employments are at an end. They walk with a quick pace with the person they are speaking to, and when they arrive at the speaker's college, the speaker reflects on how the creature they left in their apartment might still be there. The speaker then darts up to their room, throws the door open, and steps in, but the room is empty. The speaker is overjoyed at the creature having fled.
