The Marquis de Saint-Euverte tells his nephew that he would rather die than see the property and France fall into his hands, because he knows he would not be able to take care of them. The nephew sadly agrees, saying that the property is not worth mentioning anyway. The Marquis then goes on to say that if the property did come into his nephew's hands, he would abandon it immediately.
