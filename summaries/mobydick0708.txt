Ahab and the crew of the Pequod spot a ship called the Bachelor and Ahab calls out to them, asking if they have seen the White Whale. The commander of the Bachelor good-naturedly replies that they haven't seen the whale, but invites Ahab to come aboard. Ahab declines and the two ships go their separate ways.
