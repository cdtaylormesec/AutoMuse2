A dense crowd gathers at the windlass on a ship. Suddenly, the ship tips over on its side. The bolts in the ship start like nails in cold weather. The ship trembles, quivers, and nods its mast-heads to the sky. It leans more and more over to the whale. The windlass is answered by a heave from the billows. There is a sudden snap, and the whale is pulled up by the tackle, with the blubber attached. The blubber is peeled off in strips, like an orange. The men at the windlass cease heaving, and the blood-dripping mass sways to and fro.
