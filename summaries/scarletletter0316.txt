The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale is about to confess his sin to the people of Boston from the scaffold, supported by Hester Prynne and holding the hand of her daughter, Pearl. He says that he knows this is better than what they dreamed of in the forest. Hester replies that she does not know if it is better or not, but the minister says that it is as God has willed it.
