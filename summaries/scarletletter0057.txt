This passage discusses the author's observations of the different attitudes of the victorious Democrats and defeated Whigs after an election. The Democrats are generally more magnanimous in victory, while the Whigs are more resentful. The author concludes that he would rather be on the losing side than the winning side, since the latter can be more ruthless. However, the author's own head was the first to fall.
