Lady Agatha and Sir Thomas Burdon are discussing the discovery of America and its inhabitants. Lady Agatha is not happy with the state of affairs, while Sir Thomas finds amusement in it. The Radical member interjects with some facts, which bore the duchess. She exclaims that she wish America had never been discovered at all. Mr. Erskine argues that it merely detected and not discovered. The duchess concedes that the inhabitants are pretty and dress well. Sir Thomas jokes that bad Americans go to Paris when they die.
