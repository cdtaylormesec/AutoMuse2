Tom, a bystander, and Michaelis, the man who found the body, are talking to a police officer about a hit-and-run that just occurred. A well-dressed black man interjects and says he saw the car that did it. Wilson, who was in the office with the victim when she was hit, starts yelling and Tom has to hold him back.
