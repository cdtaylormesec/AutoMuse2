Mr. Bennet misses his second daughter, Elizabeth, very much. He often goes to Pemberley, the estate where she lives, to visit her. Mr. Bingley, Jane's husband, buys an estate near Pemberley so they can be closer to Elizabeth and her family. Kitty, Lydia's sister, spends more time with her older sisters and improves her behavior.
