The passage describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. Hester is wearing a scarlet letter A on her chest, and the townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by it. The preacher in the church is also affected by the letter, and the townspeople eventually turn on him as well.
