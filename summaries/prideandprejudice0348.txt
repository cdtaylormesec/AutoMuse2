Miss Bingley is venting her feelings to Darcy about how Elizabeth has changed for the worse since winter. Georgiana is with her and disagrees, saying that her brother's recommendation is enough to make her think Elizabeth is lovely and amiable. Darcy replies coolly, saying that he sees no change in Elizabeth other than a tan from travelling. Miss Bingley continues, saying that she never saw any beauty in Elizabeth to begin with.
