The passage describes the relationship between Mr. Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth, and how Chillingworth became his physician. It is hinted that Chillingworth suspects that Dimmesdale is hiding something, and that Dimmesdale's true illness has never been revealed to him. The friends of Mr. Dimmesdale eventually arranged for the two to live in the same house, so that Chillingworth could keep a constant eye on him. Some people suggested that Dimmesdale should marry one of his many devoted female followers, but he rejected the idea, preferring to remain celibate.
