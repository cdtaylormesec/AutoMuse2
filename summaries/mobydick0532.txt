This passage discusses the idea that Jonah went to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope, and how this idea was advanced by a Portuguese Catholic priest. The author then goes on to say that the Turks still believe in the historical story of Jonah, and that there is a mosque in honor of Jonah in which there is a miraculous lamp that burns without any oil.
