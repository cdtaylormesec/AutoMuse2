The snail in the passage declines to join a dance with the other sea creatures, saying that it is too far and that he is content to watch. The other creatures mock him for being a coward, but he is unperturbed. Alice, who is watching the scene, agrees that the snail is interesting to watch and notes that the creatures are all covered in crumbs.
