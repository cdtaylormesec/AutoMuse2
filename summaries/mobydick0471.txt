The passage describes the captain's orders to give the harpooners ginger instead of alcohol, and Stubb's subsequent retrieval of a dark flask and a tea-caddy from below deck. The dark flask contains spirits, which are given to Queequeg, and the tea-caddy is given to the waves. The Pequod has drifted into a sea where Right Whales are known to frequent.
