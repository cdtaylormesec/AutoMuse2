A man known as Defarge is described as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It is not difficult to find his house. Carton dines at a place of refreshment and falls asleep. He wakes up refreshed and goes to Defarge's shop. There is no customer in the shop but Jacques Three. Carton orders a small measure of wine. Madame Defarge casts a careless glance at him.
