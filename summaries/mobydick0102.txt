A group of greenhorns are aboard a ship with Queequeg, a tattooed savage. One of the greenhorns tries to imitate Queequeg behind his back, and Queequeg retaliates by picking him up and throwing him into the air. The greenhorn runs to the captain and tells on Queequeg, who is then scolded by the captain. Queequeg calmly explains that the greenhorn is much too small to warrant killing.
