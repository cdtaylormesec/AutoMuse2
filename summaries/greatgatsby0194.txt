Project Gutenberg is a library of electronic books that can be freely shared. It was started by Professor Michael S. Hart, and for 40 years he ran it with only a loose network of volunteers. Today, the Project Gutenberg website includes information on how to make donations, produce new eBooks, and subscribe to a newsletter.
