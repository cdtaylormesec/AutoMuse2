A woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown scolds a man in a purple woollen shirt, telling him to get along. Mrs. Hussey, upon learning of our desires for a supper and a bed, hurries us into a little room and tells us that she will prepare a clam for our supper. Queequeg and I wonder if one clam will be enough to satisfy our hunger, but we are pleased by the smell of the food being prepared in the kitchen.
