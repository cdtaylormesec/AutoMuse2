house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  After a moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”  “I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.  “That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”  The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.  “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”  “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”  “Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”  “He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”  “Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”  Jordan smiled.  “He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”  Tom and I looked at each other blankly.  “Biloxi?”  “First place, we didn’t have any president—”  Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.  “By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”  “Not exactly.”  “Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”  “Yes—I went there.”
