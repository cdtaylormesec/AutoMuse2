Darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment       to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong       to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the       acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,       replied thus:        “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me       leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I       look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself.”
