point on which I want your advice. I       want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our       acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”        Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can       be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your       opinion?”        “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised       me to make his communication public.
