case,       you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole       of this business, I will immediately give directions to       Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be       the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore       stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.       Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write       explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be       married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She       comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more       is determined on. Yours, etc.,        “EDW. GARDINER.”        “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it       be possible that he will marry her?”        “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said       her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”        “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.        “No; but it must be done soon.”        Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time       before he wrote.        “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write       immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a       case.”        “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble       yourself.”        “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”        And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the       house.
