everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”        “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,       “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”        “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with       _him_, if I were you.”        “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him.”        “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as       pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,       everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I       may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”        “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily       forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”        “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all       that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common       indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or       imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the       words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without       being vain.
