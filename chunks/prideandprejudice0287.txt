engaged, on one hand collecting an account of       the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,       on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and       Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was       enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who       would hear her.        “Oh!

And then       when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have       got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we       were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,       that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”        To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear       sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be       congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they       would have no charms for _me_—I should infinitely prefer a book.”        But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.
