intending to trace their route. He did       trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering       that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the       chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this       is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not       what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side       London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing       them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and       Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to       pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,       and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to       his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one       can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think       so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for       them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first       plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young       woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose       her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,       that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he       shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.       was not a man to be trusted.
