insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.  “Going aboard?”  “Hands off, will you,” said I.  “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”  “Ain’t going aboard, then?”  “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”  “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.  “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.”  “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”  “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”  “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few paces.  “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”  But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?”  Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”  “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”  Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will ye?  “Find who?”  “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off.
