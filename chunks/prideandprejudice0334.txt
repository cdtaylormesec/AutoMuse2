newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation       of Elizabethâ€™s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was       quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of       disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should       have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious       to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing       would fail her.        She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she       walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw       such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made       everything worse.        Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable       introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that       her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.       Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was       exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes       convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it       difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.        Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,       though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her       appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her       brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her       manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.
