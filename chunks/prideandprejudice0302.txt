frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed       it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,       that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had       been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference       secured at any time by their renewal.        On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he       dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little       was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on       his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had       passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr.       Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,       if he was acquainted with the former.        He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s       recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly       seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very       gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer       was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon       afterwards added:        “How long did you say he was at Rosings?”        “Nearly three weeks.”        “And you saw him frequently?”        “Yes, almost every day.”        “His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”        “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon       acquaintance.”        “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.
