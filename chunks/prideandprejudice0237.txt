“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have       experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of       greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons       cannot marry where they like.”        “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very       often do.”        “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not       many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some       attention to money.”        “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at       the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And       pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless       the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask       above fifty thousand pounds.”        He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To       interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with       what had passed, she soon afterwards said:        “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the       sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not       marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,       perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is       under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”        “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he       must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of       Miss Darcy.”
