object of this work to give a description of       Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which       their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,       Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of       Derbyshire is all the present concern.

She felt that she had no business at       Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after       going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains.        Mrs.
