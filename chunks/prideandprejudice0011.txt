between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His       character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man       in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again.

I hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much       better dance.”        “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am       particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as       this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with.”        “I would not be so fastidious as you are,”
