take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you       one? You are very ill.”        “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.       “There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only       distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from       Longbourn.”        She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes       could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could       only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her       in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just       had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be       concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her       friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr.       Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him       too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,       nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”        Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in       a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_       who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it       only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his       character been known, this could not have happened. But it is       all—all too late now.”        “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it       certain—absolutely certain?”
