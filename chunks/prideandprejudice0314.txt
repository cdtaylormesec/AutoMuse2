examining the nearer aspect of the house, all       her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest       the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,       they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited       for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she       was.        The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much       less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding       her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,       well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after       slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.       The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving       increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.       Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the       whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with       delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were       taking different positions; but from every window there were       beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their       furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but       Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither       gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real       elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
