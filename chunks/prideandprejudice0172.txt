at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in       Hertfordshire before he left the country.        Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the       rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed       affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss       Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions       were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their       increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment       of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She       wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate       of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of       the latter with regard to new furniture.        Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all       this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided       between concern for her sister, and resentment against all       others. To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to       Miss Darcy she paid no credit.
