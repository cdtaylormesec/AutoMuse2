lately as Mr. Collins was       wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it       over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am       not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable       home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and       situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness       with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state.”        Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward       pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not       stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness       of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had       always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,       when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins       was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
