“I did love him once—but I loved you too.”  Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.  “You loved me too?” he repeated.  “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”  The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.  “I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”  “Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”  “Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.  She turned to her husband.  “As if it mattered to you,” she said.  “Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”  “You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”  “I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”  “Daisy’s leaving you.”  “Nonsense.”  “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.  “She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”  “I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”  “Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”  “You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby
