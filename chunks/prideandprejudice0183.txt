sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she       may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to       _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.       But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?       Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything.”        Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt       persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.        “I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard       to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a       part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you       well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that       they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.”        “And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of       his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on       Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think       of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as       Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter       it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”        “So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does       not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to       help calling.”
