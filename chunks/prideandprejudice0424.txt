honour, he had been able to get the better of       himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and       again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even       sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding       how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that       affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.        She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s       approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was       overtaken by Wickham.        “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?”       said he, as he joined her.        “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not       follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”        “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good       friends; and now we are better.”        “True. Are the others coming out?”        “I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage       to Meryton.

And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she       was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my       name to you.”        “Yes, she did.”
