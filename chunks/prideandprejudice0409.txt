She got up, and ran out of the       room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through       the hall to the dining parlour.

She longed to see Mrs.       Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to       hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the       mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of       being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.        “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the       breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a       charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope       they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.
