laugh at them whenever I can. But these,       I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”        “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the       study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a       strong understanding to ridicule.”        “Such as vanity and pride.”        “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a       real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good       regulation.”        Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.        “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss       Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”        “I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He       owns it himself without disguise.”        “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults       enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I       dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little       yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I       cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,       nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed       about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be       called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.”        “_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable       resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your       fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”
