thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.  “You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”  “I am careful.”  “No, you’re not.”  “Well, other people are,” she said lightly.  “What’s that got to do with it?”  “They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”  “Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”  “I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”  Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.  Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.
