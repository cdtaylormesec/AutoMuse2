her what he wanted. She would       not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,       for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham       indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had       she been able to receive them into her house, they would have       taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind       friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street.       He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His       first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her       to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,       offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found       Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared       for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not       hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some       time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were       her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and       expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with       Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He       confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of       some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not       to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own       folly alone.
