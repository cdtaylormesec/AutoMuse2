oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey.  So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by   an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National   Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it   appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and   portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the   ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of   longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve   columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of
