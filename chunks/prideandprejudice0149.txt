your daughter’s favour, without having paid       yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your       daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to       error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My       object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with       due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my       _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to       apologise.”     Chapter 21        The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end,       and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings       necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish       allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_       feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or       dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,       and especially to her friend.        The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or       ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry       pride.
