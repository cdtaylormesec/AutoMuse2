had all his money, you know; and it is the       first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few       presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a       daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was       only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,       that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write       for me. We will settle with your father about the money       afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”        She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,       and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful       orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her       to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s       delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother       was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,       too, came into her head.        “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and       tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come       back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and       order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I       am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here       comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss       Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of       punch to make merry at her wedding.”
