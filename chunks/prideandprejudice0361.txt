Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had       hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that       their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly       on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the       postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had       never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not       but be deeply afflicted.
