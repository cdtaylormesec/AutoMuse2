reason       to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous       happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle       adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.     Chapter 42        Had Elizabethâ€™s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she       could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal       felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and       beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty       generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and       illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all       real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had       vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were       overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek       comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had       brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the       unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the       country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his       principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise       indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in       general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of       entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive       benefit from such as are given.
