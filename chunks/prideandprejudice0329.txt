to-morrow,”       he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an       acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”        Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were       instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had       been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by       his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.        “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after       a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will       you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to       your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”        The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too       great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She       immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of       being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,       without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying       to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of       her.        They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.       Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was       flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her       was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the       others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.
