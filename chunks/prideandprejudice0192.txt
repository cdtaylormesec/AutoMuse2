I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit       till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the       meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not       calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and       was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went       away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no       longer.
