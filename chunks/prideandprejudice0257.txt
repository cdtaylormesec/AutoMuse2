such a choice. I described, and enforced them       earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or       delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded       by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s       indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection       with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great       natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than       on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived       himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against       returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been       given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself       for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in       the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it       is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to       conceal from him your sister’s being in town.
