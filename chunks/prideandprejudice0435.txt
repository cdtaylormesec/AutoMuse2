degree by a distinction so ill applied.        Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a       question which she could not answer without confusion, said       scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the       reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.       There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.       But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his       voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of       curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found       him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object       but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,       than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was       disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.        “Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he       come?”        She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;       and to him she had hardly courage to speak.        She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.        “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.       Bennet.        He readily agreed to it.        “I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People       _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;       but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have       happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.
