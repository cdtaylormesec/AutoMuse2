what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would       not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour       while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter       last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a       piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no       fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious       manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had       done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If       she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not       listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my       dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with       her.        “Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,       attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to       leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry       with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying       (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.       His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as       when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all       please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and       _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I       thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But       slyness seems the fashion.
