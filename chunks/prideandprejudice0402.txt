There       were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently       depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge       of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much—not,       however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to       herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between       them.
