party. “I       assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I       believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I       am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be       so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so       they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably       till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,       more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings       certainly increases.”        Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,       which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.        Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed       out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by       supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she       added:        “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg       that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad       of your company, I am sure.”        “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”       replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I       must be in town next Saturday.”        “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I       expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before       you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.       Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”
