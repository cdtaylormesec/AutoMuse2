“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?       Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age       are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the       true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.”        As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the       manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss       Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she       had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly       replied:        “You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I       dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.       She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my       acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard       you say that you know them.”        “I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike       man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”        “Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to       Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”        “Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him       in those points where he most wants care. From something that he       told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley       very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I       have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It       was all conjecture.”
