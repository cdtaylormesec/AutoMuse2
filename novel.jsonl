Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the wall; awaking, however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: Young Jerry sees his father and two other fishermen sneak through a gate into a blind lane.

The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.  Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.  The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps.

They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish.  They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father\u2019s.  But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.

This envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past, when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present. There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of his Majesty\u2019s Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. I remember to have read (probably in Felt\u2019s Annals) a notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; and likewise, in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of St. Peter\u2019s Church, during the renewal of that edifice.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dr. Manette is a physician who has been wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille. Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.

As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own.

The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The author knew that they should have been replaced by younger, more fit men, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage describes a person finding an old document in a graveyard. The document is a commission from Governor Shirley to Jonathan Pue, appointing him Surveyor of Customs in Salem. The person remembers reading about Pue's death and the digging up of his remains, and notes that only a skeleton and some fragments of clothing were all that remained of him. Hester Prynne's appearance had changed drastically since she committed adultery and she was no longer seen as a desirable woman.

It was a sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine. It was due in part to all these causes, but still more to something else, that there seemed to be no longer anything in Hester\u2019s face for Love to dwell upon; nothing in Hester\u2019s form, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester\u2019s bosom, to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute had departed from her, the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman. Such is frequently the fate, and such the stern development, of the feminine character and person, when the woman has encountered, and lived through, an experience of peculiar severity. If she be all tenderness, she will die. If she survive, the tenderness will either be crushed out of her, or\u2014and the outward semblance is the same\u2014crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. She who has once been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transfiguration.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art and how it is seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves.

As bad as Basil says?\u201d  \u201cThere is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral\u2014immoral from the scientific point of view.\u201d  \u201cWhy?\u201d  \u201cBecause to influence a person is to give him one\u2019s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else\u2019s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one\u2019s nature perfectly\u2014that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one\u2019s self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it.

Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry.

Calm in Storm   Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The narrator is impressed by Gatsby's sensitivity and ability to connect with people, despite his own reservations about him. Tom and Gatsby are arguing about whether Gatsby actually went to Oxford. Daisy tries to intervene, but Tom is not interested in hearing what she has to say.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness.

Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The narrator is impressed by Gatsby's sensitivity and ability to connect with people, despite his own reservations about him.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man, is moving into the neighborhood. Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant.

Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased.

As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The author knew that they should have been replaced by younger, more fit men, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. Two ghosts that were once intimately connected in life are now standing coldly and shuddering from each other in mutual dread, because they are not yet used to being disembodied beings. They are also both scared of themselves, because their consciousness has been revealed to them in a way that life never does, except at such intense moments. They slowly and hesitantly reach out to touch each other's hand, and then they sit down and start talking about things that are bothering them the most. The passage describes a mother and child, with the child having a \" never-failing vivacity of spirits.\" The mother wonders if the child will ever have a deep grief that will make her sympathetic.

The first time was three or four years since, when I favored the reader\u2014inexcusably, and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine\u2014with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now\u2014because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion\u2014I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three years\u2019 experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous \u201cP. P., Clerk of this Parish,\u201d was never more faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him, better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed, only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer\u2019s own nature, and complete his circle of\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "existence by bringing him into communion with it.

All other scenes of earth\u2014even that village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother\u2019s keeping, like garments put off long ago\u2014were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken.  It might be, too,\u2014doubtless it was so, although she hid the secret from herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart, like a serpent from its hole,\u2014it might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal. There dwelt, there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognized on earth, would bring them together before the bar of final judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a joint futurity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon Hester\u2019s contemplation, and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized, and then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked the idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon.

[Illustration: The Lonesome Dwelling]  Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. In this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with her infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot. Children, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from"}

The closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. When no longer called upon to speak, or listen, either of which operations cost him an evident effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude. It was not painful to behold this look; for, though dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. The framework of his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin.  To observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may remain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of peace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.  Nevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection,\u2014for, slight as was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be termed so,\u2014I could discern the main points of his portrait.

The heat that had formerly pervaded his nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze; but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight, solidity, firmness; this was the expression of his repose, even in such decay as had crept untimely over him, at the period of which I speak. But I could imagine, even then, that, under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,\u2014roused by a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all his energies that were not dead, but only slumbering,\u2014he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man\u2019s gown, dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and starting up once more a warrior. And, in so intense a moment, his demeanor would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired. What I saw in him\u2014as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile\u2014were the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and of benevolence, which,"}

Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child\u2019s expanding nature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being.  Certainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape, its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden; worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels, after the world\u2019s first parents were driven out. The child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye. So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor of Pearl\u2019s own proper beauty, shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her, on the darksome cottage floor.

Hester could only account for the child\u2019s character\u2014and even then most vaguely and imperfectly\u2014by recalling what she herself had been, during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of earth.

At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter, it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully, than at any time since the first day she put it on.  While Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her forever, the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control.

In the open air their rapture broke into speech. The street and the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of the minister. His hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear. According to their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his.

It is my belief, however, that, had I attempted a different order of composition, my faculties would not have been found so pointless and inefficacious. I might, for instance, have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster, one of the Inspectors, whom I should be most ungrateful not to mention, since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and admiration by his marvellous gifts as a story-teller. Could I have preserved the picturesque force of his style, and the humorous coloring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions, the result, I honestly believe, would have been something new in literature. Or I might readily have found a more serious task.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own.

The author knew that they should have been replaced by younger, more fit men, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The child in the passage is described as being beautiful and graceful, with a 'circle of radiance' around them. Regardless of what they wear, they always look perfect. The passage describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. Hester is wearing a scarlet letter A on her chest, and the townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by it. The preacher in the church is also affected by the letter, and the townspeople eventually turn on him as well.

They suggest that it would have been wiser to write about the present day, infused with thought and imagination.

But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. It might be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man\u2019s fire-water had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest. It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows. In either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanor on the part of the spectators; as befitted a people amongst whom religion and law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful. Meagre, indeed, and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold.

Morally, as well as materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding, than in their fair descendants, separated from them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother has transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less force and solidity, than her own.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The narrator is impressed by Gatsby's sensitivity and ability to connect with people, despite his own reservations about him. Tom and Gatsby are arguing about whether Gatsby actually went to Oxford. Daisy tries to intervene, but Tom is not interested in hearing what she has to say. Gatsby is content with the argument, because it means that they are finally out in the open. Jordan Baker tells the narrator that she is engaged to another man, and the narrator reflects on a conversation they had about driving. A man named Bill Biloxi stayed with the narrator's family for three weeks, until her father told him to leave. The day after he left, her father died. The narrator later remarked to her husband that Biloxi was from Memphis, and he gave her an aluminum putter that she still uses. Tom is talking to Daisy, who is extemporizing about how much she loves Nick. Miss Baker is trying to eavesdrop on their conversation, and she and Nick exchange a glance. Nick says he doesn't know what's going on, and Miss Baker is surprised. She tells him that everybody knows about Tom's affair. Tom and Daisy are discussing Gatsby's \"old sport\" expression, and Tom is Not happy. Daisy changes the subject to their own wedding in Louisville, which prompts Jordan to mention that someone fainted.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The narrator, Nick, is reflecting on the events following Jay Gatsby's death.

Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable past, and clustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now. The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood\u2019s heart of mystery, which had become a mystery of joy.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry.

Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. Monseigneur holds a reception in his grand hotel in Paris, during which Mr. Cruncher, a working class man, becomes angry with his wife for what he perceives to be her deliberate sabotaging of his attempts to make money.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The narrator, Nick, is reflecting on the events following Jay Gatsby's death. In particular, he focuses on Tom and Daisy's discussion of Gatsby's \"old sport\" expression, and how Daisy changing the subject to their own wedding in Louisville prompts Jordan to mention that someone fainted. Gatsby tells the narrator not to talk so much, and the narrator reflects on how Gatsby's happiness is based on an illusion. The passage also describes Catherine's determination to prove her sister's innocence, and how Wilson is reduced to a man deranged by grief. In the end, the narrator reflects on his responsibility for Gatsby's death. The passage describes a woman's reaction to the parties at Gatsby's house.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the reaction of Mr. Lorry, a British man, to learning about the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution. Lorry is troubled by the news, but tries to remain positive and hopeful. Mr. Lorry and Monseigneur, a powerful lord at Court, discuss the upcoming revolution in France. Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. The passage describes a man who has followed another man into a wine shop, and deduced from his conversation and the rumors going around about him that he is a spy. He then offers to explain his purpose for doing so in more detail at the man's office, and the man agrees. The passage describes a daughter's love for her father, and how this love is stronger and more pure than any other love. The father is moved by this declaration, and the speaker says that he has refrained from expressing his own love for the daughter because he does not want to tarnish the purity of her love.\n\nLast chunk: with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself.

I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck.

She had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled, or, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. She saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not already stepped across it. It was impossible to doubt, that, whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse, a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief. A secret enemy had been continually by his side, under the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale\u2019s nature. Hester could not but ask herself, whether there had not originally been a defect of truth, courage, and loyalty, on her own part, in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded, and nothing auspicious to be hoped. Her only justification lay in the fact, that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself, except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth\u2019s scheme of disguise. Under that impulse, she had made her choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretched alternative of the two. She determined to redeem her error, so far as it might yet be possible.

In fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe. The occasion was not long to seek. One afternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician, with a basket on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stooping along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicines withal.

It is hinted that Chillingworth suspects that Dimmesdale is hiding something, and that Dimmesdale's true illness has never been revealed to him. The friends of Mr. Dimmesdale eventually arranged for the two to live in the same house, so that Chillingworth could keep a constant eye on him.

This latter step, however, there was no present prospect that Arthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected all suggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church-discipline.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry.

The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, \u2018My husband, my father, and my brother!\u2019 the counting up to twelve, and \u2018Hush!\u2019 The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer\u2019s breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.  \u201cFor the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:  \u201c\u2018There is another patient.\u2019  \u201cI was startled, and asked, \u2018Is it a pressing case?\u2019  \u201c\u2018You had better see,\u2019 he carelessly answered; and took up a light.          *****  \u201cThe other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "over a stable.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries.\n\nLast chunk: organ.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.  \u201cIt is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\u201d said Lord Henry languidly. \u201cYou must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar.

As a first step, the whole system of society is to be torn down, and built up anew. Then, the very nature of the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which has become like nature, is to be essentially modified, before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position. Finally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change; in which, perhaps, the ethereal essence, wherein she has her truest life, will be found to have evaporated. A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought. They are not to be solved, or only in one way. If her heart chance to come uppermost, they vanish. Thus, Hester Prynne, whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew in the dark labyrinth of mind; now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice; now starting back from a deep chasm. There was wild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfort nowhere. At times, a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to heaven, and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide.

Mr. Lorry admires the youthfulness and gallantry of the revolutionaries, while Monseigneur talks about how he will take revenge on them. The passage describes a man who has followed another man into a wine shop, and deduced from his conversation and the rumors going around about him that he is a spy. He then offers to explain his purpose for doing so in more detail at the man's office, and the man agrees. The passage describes a daughter's love for her father, and how this love is stronger and more pure than any other love. The father is moved by this declaration, and the speaker says that he has refrained from expressing his own love for the daughter because he does not want to tarnish the purity of her love.

She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.\n\nStory so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has various adventures. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world, and the Caterpillar comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. The caterpillar tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice comes across a house in a clearing and wonders how to get to the garden. She is hesitant to approach the house because she doesn't want to frighten whoever lives there. She eventually decides to approach the house and is greeted by two footmen. One of the footmen has a letter for the Duchess, which Alice is curious about. The Footman tells Alice that it is useless to knock on the door because he is on the same side as she is. He also says that there is so much noise going on inside that no one would be able to hear her anyway.\n\nLast chunk: from the Queen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.  \u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for two reasons. First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.  \u201cPlease, then,\u201d said Alice, \u201chow am I to get in?\u201d  \u201cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201d the Footman went on without attending to her, \u201cif we had the door between us.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage also describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. The townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by the scarlet letter A that Hester is wearing. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. They suggest that it would have been wiser to write about the present day, infused with thought and imagination. The passage describes a dying man's final moments and words. He is speaking to his daughter, Pearl, and tells her that he fears they will not be able to meet in an everlasting and pure reunion after death because of the sin they have committed. However, he remains hopeful that God is merciful and will forgive them.\n\nLast chunk: the child.  \u201cMy little Pearl,\u201d said he, feebly,\u2014and there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep repose; nay, now that the burden was removed, it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with the child,\u2014\u201cdear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now? Thou wouldst not, yonder, in the forest! But now thou wilt?\u201d  Pearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great scene of grief, in which the wild infant bore a part, had developed all her sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father\u2019s cheek, they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be a woman in it.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage also describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. The townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by the scarlet letter A that Hester is wearing. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. They suggest that it would have been wiser to write about the present day, infused with thought and imagination. The passage describes a dying man's final moments and words. He is speaking to his daughter, Pearl, and tells her that he fears they will not be able to meet in an everlasting and pure reunion after death because of the sin they have committed. However, he remains hopeful that God is merciful and will forgive them.

There would have been something sad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. It might be true, indeed, that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long; else, it might have made me permanently other than I had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take. But I never considered it as other than a transitory life.

The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.  There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen.

A group of people are playing a wine game in a Paris suburb when the wine is suddenly spilled. The game quickly ends and everyone goes back to their tasks, leaving a red stain on the ground.\n\nLast chunk: miraculous presence.  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.  The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes.

The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.  And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness.

Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage also describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. The townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by the scarlet letter A that Hester is wearing. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. They suggest that it would have been wiser to write about the present day, infused with thought and imagination. The passage describes a dying man's final moments and words. He is speaking to his daughter, Pearl, and tells her that he fears they will not be able to meet in an everlasting and pure reunion after death because of the sin they have committed. However, he remains hopeful that God is merciful and will forgive them. The passage is about the narrator's change in perspective and how it does not bother him because he knows it is temporary. The passage describes the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The tone and cadence of the voice is musical and evokes emotions in the listener. The voice is also plaintive, expressing the suffering of humanity.\n\nLast chunk: whole sermon to her ears, in the shape of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of the minister\u2019s very peculiar voice.  This vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; insomuch that a listener, comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence. Like all other music, it breathed passion and pathos, and emotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the human heart, wherever educated. Muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church-walls, Hester Prynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized so intimately, that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her, entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These, perhaps, if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium, and have clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low undertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; then ascended with it, as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power, until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur. And yet, majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was forever in it an essential character of plaintiveness. A loud or low expression of anguish,\u2014the whisper, or the shriek, as it might be conceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility in every bosom! At times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a desolate silence. But even when the\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "minister\u2019s voice grew high and commanding,\u2014when it gushed irrepressibly upward,\u2014when it assumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself in the open air,\u2014still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the purpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. What was it? The complaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind; beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,\u2014at every moment,\u2014in each accent,\u2014and never in vain! It was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power.  During all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of the scaffold. If the minister\u2019s voice had not kept her there, there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy. There was a sense within her,\u2014too ill-defined to be made a thought, but weighing heavily on her mind,\u2014that her whole orb of life, both before and after, was connected with this spot, as with the one point that gave it unity.

Young Jerry is pursued by a coffin throughout the night.\n\nLast chunk: spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy\u2019s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.  From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes how Rosy Rosenthal was shot and killed. It happened late at night, and the group of people he was with were still awake. They were sitting in a room, and when the waiter came to tell Rosy that someone wanted to speak to him outside, they pulled him back down into his chair and told him not to go. The person who shot him then left. The passage describes a party at Gatsby's house, where the narrator sees Jordan and Daisy.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age.

It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson\u2019s home-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, in both minister and man of physic. The motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontide shadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round with tapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events, representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer. Here the pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines, even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yet constrained often to avail themselves.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage also describes the reaction of the townspeople to Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery. The townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by the scarlet letter A that Hester is wearing. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. They suggest that it would have been wiser to write about the present day, infused with thought and imagination. The passage describes a dying man's final moments and words. He is speaking to his daughter, Pearl, and tells her that he fears they will not be able to meet in an everlasting and pure reunion after death because of the sin they have committed. However, he remains hopeful that God is merciful and will forgive them. The passage is about the narrator's change in perspective and how it does not bother him because he knows it is temporary.

The voice is also plaintive, expressing the suffering of humanity. The passage describes a tombstone bearing the escutcheon of the letter A, which symbolizes the conclusion of the legend.

The home is near a chapel and has a view of a graveyard, which is said to be conducive to serious reflections. The walls of the home are hung with tapestries depicting Biblical scenes. The minister has a library in his room, filled with books from various religious traditions. The health of Mr. Dimmesdale, a religious leader in New England, is failing. Some believe that he is too good for this world and believe that his death would be a good thing. However, Mr. Dimmesdale himself believes that if he is going to die, it is because Providence has willed it.

As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that a wealthy young man from up north is moving into the neighborhood.

His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's reflections on history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also describes the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The Bristol ship commander, upon recognizing Hester Prynne, addressed her politely. People generally give her a wide berth, due to her unfriendly demeanor and the scarlet letter she wears. This passage discusses the author's observations of the different attitudes of the victorious Democrats and defeated Whigs after an election. The Democrats are generally more magnanimous in victory, while the Whigs are more resentful. The author concludes that he would rather be on the losing side than the winning side, since the latter can be more ruthless. However, the author's own head was the first to fall.\n\nLast chunk: chopped off all our heads, and have thanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me\u2014who have been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat\u2014that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. The Democrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them, and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare, which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it were weakness and cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of victory has made them generous. They know how to spare, when they see occasion; and when they strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed, but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off.  In short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I saw much reason to congratulate myself that I was on the losing side, rather than the triumphant one. If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of partisans, I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; nor was it without something like regret and shame, that, according to a reasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my Democratic brethren.

Nevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it, if the sufferer will but make the best, rather than the worst, of the accident which has befallen him. In my particular case, the consolatory topics were close at hand, and, indeed, had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them. In view of my previous weariness of office, and vague thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, although beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered. In the Custom-House, as before in the Old Manse, I had spent three years; a term long enough to rest a weary brain; long enough to break off old intellectual habits, and make room for new ones; long enough, and too long, to have lived in an unnatural state, doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being, and withholding myself from toil that would, at least, have stilled an unquiet impulse in me.

Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.  Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.

No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands.  In a moment, the whole company were on their feet.

Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes how Rosy Rosenthal was shot and killed.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's reflections on history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also describes the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The Bristol ship commander, upon recognizing Hester Prynne, addressed her politely. People generally give her a wide berth, due to her unfriendly demeanor and the scarlet letter she wears. This passage discusses the author's observations of the different attitudes of the victorious Democrats and defeated Whigs after an election.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes how Rosy Rosenthal was shot and killed.

Then, moreover, as regarded his unceremonious ejectment, the late Surveyor was not altogether ill-pleased to be recognized by the Whigs as an enemy; since his inactivity in political affairs\u2014his tendency to roam, at will, in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet, rather than confine himself to\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one another\u2014had sometimes made it questionable with his brother Democrats whether he was a friend. Now, after he had won the crown of martyrdom (though with no longer a head to wear it on), the point might be looked upon as settled. Finally, little heroic as he was, it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand, than to remain a forlorn survivor, when so many worthier men were falling; and, at last, after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration, to be compelled then to define his position anew, and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one.  Meanwhile the press had taken up my affair, and kept me, for a week or two, careering through the public prints, in my decapitated state, like Irving\u2019s Headless Horseman; ghastly and grim, and longing to be buried, as a politically dead man ought. So much for my figurative self. The real human being, all this time, with his head safely on his shoulders, had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best; and, making an investment in ink, paper, and steel-pens, had opened his long-disused writing-desk, and was again a literary man.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: A wealthy young man from up north, Mr. Bingley, is moving into the neighborhood and Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him. However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor.

Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us.

Vanity and pride are different things, though the       words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without       being vain.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

The passage describes a meeting between the narrator and a woman who turns out to be the Marquis St. Evrmonde's wife. The woman is very upset and tells the narrator that she hopes to find and help her husband's younger sister. The narrator can only tell her that such a sister exists, but nothing more. The passage describes the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during the time of the Revolution. Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher are out buying groceries and wine when they encounter various groups of people, some of whom seem to be excited about something. They avoid these groups and eventually find what they're looking for. Mr. Cruncher has had a change of heart and is now hoping that his wife is \"flopping\" (engaging in some sort of illicit activity). Miss Pross is distressed but hopeful that Mrs. Cruncher is finding whatever she is doing to be satisfying. Lucie visits the prison where her husband is being held every day, regardless of the weather. Every day, she kisses the prison wall before leaving. Her husband sees her occasionally, and this is enough for her. In December, she arrives at the prison to find the city celebrating.

But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white.

Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.  Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage describes the different illustrations in the book. The passage is about the author's ancestors, one of whom was a Puritan who was very cruel to the Quakers. The author is ashamed of their actions and prays for their forgiveness. The passage describes how the old, experienced customs officers at the author's workplace were gradually replaced by younger, more orthodox men. The author knew that the new officers were more fit for the job than the old ones, but he couldn't bring himself to fire them. Eventually, the new officers discovered that the author was not a threat, and they all got along. The passage describes a room in a seaport town, inhabited by old men who are retired Custom-House officers. The room is dirty and cluttered, and it is clear that it is not regularly cleaned. The passage describes a man who, despite being quite old, is still in excellent health and spirits. He is a government official, and his father was a colonel in the Revolutionary War.\n\nLast chunk: contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch.

Looking at him merely as an animal,\u2014and there was very little else to look at,\u2014he was a most satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at, or conceived of. The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; these latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart.

It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson.

She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.\n\nStory so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world where she has adventures and wonders about her identity. She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter.

{"prompt": "Outline: A young scientist, Victor Frankenstein, becomes obsessed with creating life. He eventually succeeds in creating a creature, but when he sees what he has done, he flees in horror. The creature is left alone and misunderstood. He eventually turns to evil after being continually rejected by humans. The creature seeks revenge on his creator by destroying everything Frankenstein holds dear. In the end, Frankenstein destroys the creature he created, but not before the creature destroys him.\n\nStory so far: The speaker is talking to a stranger about a shared interest, and the stranger confides in the narrator about his difficult past. The stranger tells the story of how he got to his current state, which is full of hardships. Despite all this, the man is still waiting for one more event before he can rest in peace. The author's parents were very loving and devoted to him, and he remembers them fondly. He was their only child for many years. His mother especially desired to have a daughter, but they never had any more children. This passage tells the story of a poor child who is different from the other children in her poverty-stricken village. She is thin and fair, with bright golden hair, and is so beautiful that she seems otherworldly. The peasant woman who is caring for her reveals that she is actually the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, and was left with them to nurse. The passage tells the story of a young Italian girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. The girl is very beautiful, and everyone loves her.\n\nLast chunk: were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy\u2014one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.  When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents\u2019 house\u2014my more than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.

Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives.

The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz\u2019s destiny in Little Girl Bay.  To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody\u2014he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.  He was employed in a vague personal capacity\u2014while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.

It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.  And it was from Cody that he inherited money\u2014a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn\u2019t get it.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art and how it is seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves.

The passage argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. Dorian Gray is troubled by something Basil's friend said to him, which he can't quite understand. He realizes that words can be incredibly powerful and have a lot of influence over him.

He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man, is moving into the neighborhood. Mrs. Bennet is insistent that they meet him, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately.

Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was       clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.       In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually       giving offence.        The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no       stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as       to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.       Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest, and from none received either       attention or pleasure.

{"prompt": "Outline: The Great Gatsby\" is a tale of love, ambition, and the American Dream, narrated by the young and introspective Nick Carraway, who moves to West Egg, Long Island in 1922 to work as a bond salesman. Shortly after his arrival, Nick becomes acquainted with his mysterious and wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who regularly hosts extravagant parties at his palatial mansion. Gatsby is infatuated with the beautiful and enigmatic Daisy Buchanan, who lives across the bay in East Egg with her husband, the unfaithful Tom Buchanan. As Nick becomes more deeply entwined in the lives of these captivating characters, he uncovers the intricate web of secrets, lies, and unfulfilled desires that lies beneath the glittering facade of their lives. Gatsby's all-consuming love for Daisy drives him to pursue her relentlessly, despite the fact that she is married and has a daughter. Daisy, on the other hand, is torn between her feelings for Gatsby and the security of her marriage to Tom.Meanwhile, Tom carries on an affair with Myrtle Wilson, the wife of a struggling garage owner, George Wilson. As the story progresses, tensions rise between the various characters, culminating in a series of dramatic confrontations that reveal the true nature of their relationships and the true extent of their corruption. Amidst the dazzling parties and the opulence of 1920s New York, Nick must grapple with his own moral compass, as he is torn between his attraction to the allure of the wealthy elite and his growing disillusionment with their hollow, materialistic values. As the novel reaches its tragic climax, the consequences of the characters' actions come to a head, shattering the illusion of their glamorous lives and exposing the dark, decaying heart of their world.Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" serves as a poignant exploration of the pursuit of wealth, power, and love in the Jazz Age, and a meditation on the destructive power of unchecked ambition and the unattainable nature of the American Dream. Through Nick's eyes, the reader is left to ponder the consequences of a society obsessed with material success and the fleeting nature of human happiness.\n\nStory so far: Rosy Rosenthal is shot and killed, and Tom and Wilson are talking about selling Tom's car. Wilson is sick and needs money, so he and his wife want to move West. The man from Minnesota who arrives in town after receiving a telegram that Mr. Gatsby has died is revealed to be Gatsby's father.\n\nLast chunk: at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. \u201cThese people!

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful.\n\nLast chunk: whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. \u201cNot send it anywhere?

We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.  My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.

As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discuss the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room.\n\nThe passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well.\n\nThis passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.\n\nLast chunk: morrow, I should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance.

Mr. Darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he       looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees.\n\nLast chunk: the artist is in accord with himself.

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.  \u201cIt is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\u201d said Lord Henry languidly. \u201cYou must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.

When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.  The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the"}

He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere. Wilson's wife then appears and Tom is immediately struck by her sensual beauty. Tom Buchanan and his girlfriend go to New York to meet up with Nick Carraway, who is Mrs. Wilson's sister's husband. Mrs. Wilson accompanies them in a separate car. Mrs. Wilson changes her dress and buys a few things before getting into a taxi. She tells the driver that she wants to buy a dog, and he takes them to a man selling puppies.

The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.  The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.  \u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.  \u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.  \u201cIt _is_ a\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014           \u201cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \u2018Let us both          go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.\u2014Come, I\u2019ll take no          denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I\u2019ve          nothing to do.\u2019 Said the mouse to the cur, \u2018Such a trial, dear          sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\u2019          \u2018I\u2019ll be judge, I\u2019ll be jury,\u2019 Said cunning old Fury: \u2018I\u2019ll          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\u2019\u201d  \u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d  \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d  \u201cI had _not!_\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.  \u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d  \u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d  \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d  The Mouse only growled in reply.  \u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker."}

She eventually decides to stay in the fantastical world rather than return to the real world. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice encounters a pigeon who accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice denies this, but the pigeon insists that all serpents must eat eggs. This frustrates Alice, who is not looking for eggs.\n\nLast chunk: no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d  \u201cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d  \u201cIt matters a good deal to _me_,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want _yours_: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d  \u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself,\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now!

It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. A cask of wine has fallen and broken in the street, and people are taking advantage of the situation to drink as much of the wine as they can. Mr. Lorry, observing the scene, hopes that the young woman he is with will not be similarly tempted. The Dover mail is struggling up a hill, and the passengers are getting impatient. The coachman and guard are both worried about a horse that is approaching at a gallop.

The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.  The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.

It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The passage discusses the idea that people are afraid of themselves and have forgotten the duty they owe to themselves. It also argues that courage has gone out of our race. The passage argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it.\n\nLast chunk: conscious only that a look had come into the lad\u2019s face that he had never seen there before.  \u201cAnd yet,\u201d continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, \u201cI believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream\u2014I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of medi\u00e6valism, and return to the Hellenic ideal\u2014to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.

The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others.\n\nLast chunk: they are!

Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents.\n\nLast chunk: *       *       *       *       *  In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,\u2014but which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood,\u2014at the head, I say, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass,\u2014here, with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbor, stands a spacious edifice of brick.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise. Elizabeth is surprised to find Jane at breakfast with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, who seem to disapprove of her having walked three miles in the cold. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Hurst are also there.

She was received, however, very       politely by them; and in their brother\u2019s manners there was       something better than politeness; there was good humour and       kindness.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry Wotton that he does not want him to meet Dorian Gray, as he is the only person who gives his art whatever charm it possesses. Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him.\n\nLast chunk: shadowy and sensual.

The chief tragic event of the old man\u2019s life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no impression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw.

Most persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to hint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. The old Inspector was incapable of it, and, were he to continue in office to the end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite.

And when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another       young man.        Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine       women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.       Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome       features, noble mien, and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "having       ten thousand a year.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,       danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and       talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. A cask of wine has fallen and broken in the street, and people are taking advantage of the situation to drink as much of the wine as they can. Mr. Lorry, observing the scene, hopes that the young woman he is with will not be similarly tempted. The Dover mail is struggling up a hill, and the passengers are getting impatient. The coachman and guard are both worried about a horse that is approaching at a gallop. It turns out to be a highwayman, and the guard shoots him. The passage tells the story of a man named Manette who was imprisoned unjustly. His wife implored the king and queen for help, but no one could find him. Manette eventually escaped and found his way back to his wife and child. The guard on the coach is worried about the message he heard and decides to investigate.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new. The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written. Art is a surface and symbol that can be interpreted in different ways, and the fact that critics often disagree about a work of art shows that it is complex and vital. This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. Basil Hallward is looking at a portrait of a young man that he has painted, and Lord Henry compliments him on it. Basil says that he doesn't want to send it to any art galleries. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the idea that people enjoy secrecy and deception in their lives, and that this can make life more interesting.\n\nLast chunk: be worth; Dorian Gray\u2019s good looks\u2014we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\u201d  \u201cDorian Gray?

The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.

As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The person narrator is talking about Daisy, a girl he is cousins with. He describes her as being very charismatic and having a voice that is mesmerizing. He talks about how she always seemed to be having exciting adventures and how everyone who met her seemed to fall in love with her. This passage describes a scene in which the characters are discussing a trip to New York. The passage describes Daisy's affection for Nick, and her admiration for his resemblance to a rose. The passage describes a woman's reaction to her husband receiving a phone call from another woman. The woman is visibly upset and leaves the table, followed by the narrator's questioning of what is happening. Miss Baker informs the narrator that the husband has a woman in New York and the wife is upset about it. The husband and wife then return to the table.

I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

However, Mr. Bennet is not interested and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. The passage describes Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him.

Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family.\n\nLast chunk: summer sky. \u201cYes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.\u201d  \u201cI should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.\u201d  \u201cMy dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.\u201d  \u201cAnd much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?\u201d  \u201cOh, brothers! I don\u2019t care for brothers. My elder brother won\u2019t die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.\u201d  \u201cHarry!\u201d exclaimed Hallward, frowning.  \u201cMy dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can\u2019t help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent.

That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman\u2014always a rash thing to do\u2014he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don\u2019t propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.

For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.

We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.

About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty. It argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. The passage discusses the transitory nature of beauty and youth, and how they are often taken for granted. It argues that beauty is a form of genius, and that those who have it should enjoy it while they can. The passage describes Dorian Gray's reaction to seeing his own portrait for the first time. He is struck by its beauty and realizes that his own beauty will one day fade. Dorian Gray is upset because he will age and his portrait will not. He wishes he could trade places with the portrait. Dorian is angry with the painter for creating a portrait of him, because it will always remain young and beautiful while Dorian himself will age and die.\n\nLast chunk: you would, Basil. You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.\u201d  The painter stared in amazement.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him. This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family. This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners.\n\nLast chunk: needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once,\u2014usually from Africa or South America,\u2014or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the granite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel\u2019s papers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful or sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of. Here, likewise,\u2014the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, care-worn merchant,\u2014we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his master\u2019s ships, when he had better be sailing mimic-boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor in quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital.

But, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest. Poking and burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish in the corner; unfolding one and another document, and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves, and those of merchants, never heard of now on \u2019Change, nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such matters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "activity,\u2014and exerting my fancy, sluggish with little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old town\u2019s brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only Salem knew the way thither,\u2014I chanced to lay my hand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment. This envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past, when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present. There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of his Majesty\u2019s Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. I remember to have read (probably in Felt\u2019s Annals) a notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; and likewise, in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of St. Peter\u2019s Church, during the renewal of that edifice. Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of my respected predecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and some fragments of apparel, and a wig of majestic frizzle; which, unlike the head that it once adorned, was in very satisfactory preservation.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible.

Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways.

The highest form of criticism is autobiography. The author argues that books cannot be judged as morally good or bad, but only as well-written or badly-written.

This is a fault.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor\u2019s craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him. This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family. This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. The passage describes how the documents in the Custom-House were hidden away and forgotten, but suggests that they could still be valuable for local history. It also mentions how the families who now make up Salem's aristocracy can be traced back to the Revolution.

Much to the author\u2019s surprise, and (if he may say so without additional offence) considerably to his amusement, he finds that his sketch of official life, introductory to THE SCARLET LETTER, has created an unprecedented excitement in the respectable community immediately around him. It could hardly have been more violent, indeed, had he burned down the Custom-House, and quenched its last smoking ember in the blood of a certain venerable personage, against whom he is supposed to cherish a peculiar malevolence.

As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives. The sketch might, perhaps, have been wholly omitted, without loss to the public, or detriment to the book; but, having undertaken to write it, he conceives that it could not have been done in a better or a kindlier spirit, nor, so far as his abilities availed, with a livelier effect of truth.

Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. In the passage, two men discuss Mr. Dorian Gray. One man says that he sees Mr. Gray every day and that he is absolutely necessary to him. The other man is surprised, as he thought the first man only cared about his art. The passage discusses how the author's new muse, Dorian Gray, has inspired a fresh approach to art. The artist sees Dorian as the embodiment of a new school of thought that combines the passion of the romantic spirit with the perfection of the Greek spirit.\n\nLast chunk: second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.

I won\u2019t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way\u2014I wonder will you understand me?\u2014his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. \u2018A dream of form in days of thought\u2019\u2014who is it who says that?

The merely visible presence of this lad\u2014for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty\u2014his merely visible presence\u2014ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him. This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family. This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. The passage describes how the documents in the Custom-House were hidden away and forgotten, but suggests that they could still be valuable for local history. It also mentions how the families who now make up Salem's aristocracy can be traced back to the Revolution. This passage explains the terms of use for the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The eBook is free to use for anyone in the United States, with few restrictions. Those outside of the United States must check their local laws before using the eBook. This passage describes a man who is seemingly happy and carefree, in spite of the fact that he has experienced a great deal of loss in his life. The author suggests that this is because the man has a very simple nature, without the capacity for deep thought or feeling.\n\nLast chunk: all long since dead; the father of twenty children, most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than the Collector\u2019s junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder and graver man of the two.  I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I think, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I have already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together, that there was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with what I found in him. It might be difficult\u2014and it was so\u2014to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but surely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath, had been not unkindly given; with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age.

His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher\u2019s meat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one\u2019s very nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him; not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment, at once"}

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.

In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty. It argues that beauty is a form of genius, and that those who have it should enjoy it while they can. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. The passage describes Dorian Gray's reaction to seeing his own portrait for the first time. He is struck by its beauty and realizes that his own beauty will one day fade. Dorian Gray is upset because he will age and his portrait will not. He wishes he could trade places with the portrait. Dorian is angry with the painter for creating a portrait of him, because it will always remain young and beautiful while Dorian himself will age and die. Dorian Gray is upset with Basil Hallward and Lord Henry for making him hate the portrait Basil painted of him. He tries to destroy the portrait with a knife, but Dorian stops him.

Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort\u2019s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.

Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.

He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York, and the figure of Mr. Gatsby, who is standing alone and looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him, and Gatsby soon vanishes back into the shadows. The passage also describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but. Myrtle's husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom, and Myrtle says she is the first sweetie he's ever had. The passage describes the narrator's feelings of being both inside and outside of the conversations going on around him. He is pulled back into his chair by the argument, but he sees someone else looking up at the building. Myrtle tells the story of her first meeting with Tom. The passage describes a party where people are milling around, talking, and enjoying themselves. However, one woman's laughter is artificial, and she makes plans to buy new things tomorrow.

She meets peculiar creatures along the way, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. In the end, Alice wakes up from her dream and realizes it was all just a dream.\n\nStory so far: Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has adventures in a fantastical world. Along the way, she wonders about her identity and whether she has been changed into someone else. Ultimately, she decides that she would rather stay in the fantastical world than go back to the real world. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation.

Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters.

Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry that he has a secret, and that he is afraid to show a certain painting because it reveals that secret. Lord Henry is intrigued, and Basil tells him that the story behind the painting is that he fell in love with a man he met at a party. Lord Henry is surprised but accepts this, and the two men continue to talk. Some time after entering a room and talking to a few people, the narrator notices Dorian Gray and feels a sudden sense of terror. He has a feeling that he is on the verge of a great life event, either good or bad, and decides to leave the room out of cowardice.\n\nLast chunk: public that we are not savages.

Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then\u2014but I don\u2019t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.

It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.\u201d  \u201cConscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.

She brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.

As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the \"strangest communities in North America\" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I\u2019d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.  Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven\u2014a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy\u2014even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach\u2014but now he\u2019d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he\u2019d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible.

The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible.

He quickly becomes friends with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who seems to have it all. However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced. The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer.\n\nLast chunk: beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone.

It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. In the passage, two men discuss Mr. Dorian Gray. One man says that he sees Mr. Gray every day and that he is absolutely necessary to him.

I won\u2019t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.  Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.

His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.  Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort\u2019s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The passage describes the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. It notes that even though the events of the Revolution were horrific, they were ultimately overseen by forces of nature that are indifferent to human suffering.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage discusses the author's positive experiences working with a competent and honest man of business. The man was valued by both the author's friends and the merchants he worked with. The author appreciated the opportunity to work with someone so well-suited to his position, and took advantage of the situation to learn from him. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a \"Custom-House sketch\" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. This passage describes the various people who would be found at the Custom House in the early 19th century. Among them were the young clerk, the outward-bound sailor, the recently arrived one, the captains of the rusty little schooners, and the venerable figures in old-fashioned chairs. This passage describes a man's love for food, and how he remembers meals from long ago with great fondness. The man's life is seemingly defined by his enjoyment of good food, and the author marvels at how little other events seem to have impacted him. This passage describes the connection that a family has to a specific location, even if they have no personal attachment to the place. This is because the family has likely been living in the same place for generations, and the connection is passed down through the family. This passage describes the arrival of ships at Salem's port, and the bustle that ensues. The port is not as busy as it used to be, but on days when several ships arrive at once, there is a lot of activity. The people who come to the port include the shipmasters and the ship owners. The passage describes how the documents in the Custom-House were hidden away and forgotten, but suggests that they could still be valuable for local history. It also mentions how the families who now make up Salem's aristocracy can be traced back to the Revolution. This passage explains the terms of use for the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The eBook is free to use for anyone in the United States, with few restrictions. Those outside of the United States must check their local laws before using the eBook. This passage describes a man who is seemingly happy and carefree, in spite of the fact that he has experienced a great deal of loss in his life. The author suggests that this is because the man has a very simple nature, without the capacity for deep thought or feeling. The author of \"The Custom House\" republishes his introductory sketch without changes, noting that he believes he has done so in the best possible way.

One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.

The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor.

It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty. It argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. The passage discusses the transitory nature of beauty and youth, and how they are often taken for granted. It argues that beauty is a form of genius, and that those who have it should enjoy it while they can. The passage describes Dorian Gray's reaction to seeing his own portrait for the first time.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves. A Tale of Two Cities is a sweeping epic that explores themes of love, redemption, and sacrifice, set against the dramatic backdrop of the French Revolution.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes the reactions of British citizens to the news of the massacre of 11 hundred prisoners during the French Revolution, as well as the dangers of displeasing the Army of the Republic in France during that time. The story also tells of a man who sees a ghost, which turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news. The passage describes the French Revolution, during which many people were sentenced to brutal punishments for relatively minor offenses. It notes that even though the events of the Revolution were horrific, they were ultimately overseen by forces of nature that are indifferent to human suffering. A figure scolds the inn servants for not fetching things and orders them to bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar. The figure tenderly cares for the patient, calling her \"my precious\" and \"my bird.\" The figure is angry with Mr. Lorry, accusing him of frightening the patient.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

Finally, the passage describes a man who has been found alive after being presumed dead, and his daughter's reaction to the news.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor.

And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a city.

The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town.

He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor, as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these were many.

You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely.

The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry that he has a secret, and that he is afraid to show a certain painting because it reveals that secret.

The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments.

He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.

The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful.

However, Gatsby's life is not as perfect as it seems, and Nick soon learns that he is involved in a love affair with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a scene in which the characters are discussing a trip to New York. Daisy's affection for Nick is described, as well as her admiration for his resemblance to a rose. The passage also describes a dinner party where one of the guests, a woman, starts singing. Tom, the host, tells her that he wants to take her to the stables after dinner. The woman then gets a phone call and the subject of the stables is dropped. The dinner party ends awkwardly, with the horses never being mentioned again. The woman tells Nick that she is very cynical and that she believes that it is better for a girl to be a fool than anything else.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with.

In the end, Frankenstein destroys the creature he created, but not before the creature destroys him.\n\nStory so far: A man tells the story of his difficult past to a stranger, revealing that he is still waiting for one more event before he can rest in peace. The story includes the man's loving and devoted parents, his only child status for many years, and a young girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. King Arthur and his knights fought to free the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. The narrator had a happy childhood and was grateful for it. He was interested in the secrets of the world, both physical and metaphysical. Clerval was interested in the morality of human actions. The passage describes the narrator's happy childhood, during which their sister Elizabeth was a shining light in the family. The narrator reflects on how Elizabeth's kindness and goodness inspired them and their friend Clerval to be better people. However, the narrator's idyllic childhood was eventually shattered by misfortune. The narrator's father tells him not to waste his time on the works of Cornelius Agrippa, but the narrator is enthusiastic about the book and believes it contains great secrets.

I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.  The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage describes a man who is capable of great strength and courage, but who is also kind and good-hearted. This passage is about the author's hometown and how it has changed over time. This passage discusses the importance of interacting with people who are different from oneself, in order to develop a better understanding of the world. The author gives the example of a man who is extremely talented in business, and notes that this is the type of person who is typically successful in the Custom-House. The passage describes a man who seems out of place in his current surroundings, but who is recalled as a brave and heroic figure from the past. The man is remembered for his courage and strength, and for his simple determination to do what is necessary, no matter how difficult it may be. The passage describes a man who seems to the narrator to be little more than a animal, existing only to satisfy his appetites.

One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher\u2019s meat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one\u2019s very nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms.

The chief tragic event of the old man\u2019s life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no impression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways.

It argues that beauty is a form of genius, and that those who have it should enjoy it while they can. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. The passage describes Dorian Gray's reaction to seeing his own portrait for the first time. He is struck by its beauty and realizes that his own beauty will one day fade. Dorian Gray is upset because he will age and his portrait will not. He wishes he could trade places with the portrait. Dorian is angry with the painter for creating a portrait of him, because it will always remain young and beautiful while Dorian himself will age and die. Dorian Gray is upset with Basil Hallward and Lord Henry for making him hate the portrait Basil painted of him. He tries to destroy the portrait with a knife, but Dorian stops him. Dorian tells Basil that he loves the portrait. Basil and Lord Henry argue over who should get the portrait of Dorian Gray.

As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught up in the world of the rich and famous, and he must choose between his new lifestyle and his old values.\n\nStory so far: The passage describes a summer night in New York. The figure of Mr. Gatsby is standing alone, looking out at the stars. The narrator decides not to call out to him. The passage also describes the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage. Her husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom. The passage describes the narrator's feelings of being both inside and outside of the conversations going on around him. Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson get into a discussion and he ends up breaking her nose. A man is sitting in his bed, looking at a portfolio of paintings. In the morning, he wakes up and catches a train.

{"prompt": "Outline: Dorian Gray is a young man who is incredibly handsome. He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper.

In the end, Frankenstein destroys the creature he created, but not before the creature destroys him.\n\nStory so far: The speaker is talking to a stranger about a shared interest, and the stranger confides in the narrator about his difficult past.

The author's parents were very loving and devoted to him, and he remembers them fondly. He was their only child for many years. His mother especially desired to have a daughter, but they never had any more children. This passage tells the story of a poor child who is different from the other children in her poverty-stricken village. She is thin and fair, with bright golden hair, and is so beautiful that she seems otherworldly. The peasant woman who is caring for her reveals that she is actually the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, and was left with them to nurse. The passage tells the story of a young Italian girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. The girl is very beautiful, and everyone loves her.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul.

It describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The passage discusses the speaker's views on class and relationships. They believe that people should be careful in choosing their enemies, as they should be of good intellect. The speaker also has a low opinion of their own family. The passage discusses the relationship between an artist and their art, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography. The artist in the passage argues that this is not the case, and that art should be separate from the artist's personal life. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: This passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition.

Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler\u2019s knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith\u2019s hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker\u2019s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.  For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far:  The artist creates beautiful things, but the critic can translate those things into something new.

Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor\u2019s craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree,"}

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love.

As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: This passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The author of The Scarlet Letter was surprised and amused to find that his sketch of official life in the preface to the second edition had caused an unprecedented amount of excitement among the respectable people around him. He insists that he did not mean to offend anyone and that the sketch was simply meant to be a frank and accurate portrayal of his impressions of the characters described therein.\n\nLast chunk: might be found amiss, and to make the best reparation in his power for the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty. But it appears to him, that the only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor, and the general accuracy with which he has conveyed his sincere impressions of the characters therein described. As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives. The sketch might, perhaps, have been wholly omitted, without loss to the public, or detriment to the book; but, having undertaken to write it, he conceives that it could not have been done in a better or a kindlier spirit, nor, so far as his abilities availed, with a livelier effect of truth.

{"prompt": "Outline: In 17th-century Puritan Boston, a young woman named Hester Prynne is caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress as a constant reminder of her sin. Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own. Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: This passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The author of The Scarlet Letter was surprised and amused to find that his sketch of official life in the preface to the second edition had caused an unprecedented amount of excitement among the respectable people around him. He insists that he did not mean to offend anyone and that the sketch was simply meant to be a frank and accurate portrayal of his impressions of the characters described therein. The author has a sentimental attachment to their hometown because their family has been living there for centuries and they can't help but feel connected to the place.\n\nLast chunk: In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.  But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned progenitor,\u2014who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man of war and peace,\u2014a stronger claim than for myself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor, as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these were many.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the idea that art is useless, and that genius does not last longer than beauty.

Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state.

When wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is sure he will fall in love with one of her daughters. But Mr. Bingley is attracted to the beautiful and witty Miss Jane Bennet. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the arrival of two wealthy young men, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy, in the neighborhood of the Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet is anxious for her daughters to meet them, but Mr. Bennet is not interested. Mr. Darcy is very proud and arrogant, and is rude to Elizabeth. The passage also describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who are close friends of the Bennets. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible.

He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art and how it is seen as a form of autobiography. It contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The passage argues that genius does not last longer than beauty, and that this is why people over-educate themselves. The passage discusses the idea that people are afraid of themselves and have forgotten the duty they owe to themselves. It also argues that courage has gone out of our race. The passage argues that if everyone lived their life to the fullest, the world would be a happier place. However, people are afraid of themselves and the things they want, so they sin and are punished for it. Dorian Gray is troubled by something Basil's friend said to him, which he can't quite understand. He realizes that words can be incredibly powerful and have a lot of influence over him. Dorian Gray has a sudden realization that life is full of color and vibrancy. Lord Henry watches him with interest, knowing that he has said something that has had a profound effect on the young man. Dorian Gray is tired and wants to go sit in the garden. Basil Hallward is sorry but says that Dorian Gray's current expression is exactly what he wanted to capture in his painting. Lord Henry has not been paying Dorian Gray compliments. Lord Henry tells Dorian Gray that the secret to a happy life is to cure the soul with the senses, and the senses with the soul.\n\nLast chunk: anything he has told me.\u201d  \u201cYou know you believe it all,\u201d said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes. \u201cI will go out to the garden with you.

I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.\u201d  Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder. \u201cYou are quite right to do that,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.\u201d  The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.  \u201cYes,\u201d continued Lord Henry, \u201cthat is one of the great secrets of life\u2014to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.

There was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life\u2019s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.  \u201cLet us go and sit in the shade,\u201d said Lord Henry. \u201cParker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.

Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, a wealthy man who is new to the neighborhood, seems to disdain all the residents. When he meets the lively and beautiful Miss Elizabeth Bennet, he is intrigued but still unsure. As the two couples get to know each other, they begin to see beyond their initial impressions and fall in love.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance, and that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with.

The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.

He becomes friends with a painter named Basil Hallward, who is completely infatuated with Dorian's beauty and paints a portrait of him. Dorian becomes obsessed with his own beauty and wonders what it would be like to never grow old or die. One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways. He tries to destroy the portrait, but it seems to have a life of its own and Dorian can't bring himself to do it. In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: This passage discusses the uselessness of art, and how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely. It also describes the atmosphere in a studio, with the scent of roses and the sound of bees. The passage contains a conversation between two men, one of whom is a painter. The painter says that he cannot exhibit a certain painting because it contains too much of himself. The other man laughs and says that the painting is of a young man who is very beautiful, but that the painter himself is not beautiful. The passage suggests that it is better to be ugly and stupid than to be beautiful and intelligent, because the latter are more likely to be ruined by their difference from others. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry that he has a secret, and that he is afraid to show a certain painting because it reveals that secret. Lord Henry is intrigued, and Basil tells him that the story behind the painting is that he fell in love with a man he met at a party. Lord Henry is surprised but accepts this, and the two men continue to talk. Some time after entering a room and talking to a few people, the narrator notices Dorian Gray and feels a sudden sense of terror.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry.

One day, Dorian meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton, who tells him that the only thing that truly matters in life is experiencing as much pleasure as possible. Dorian is entranced by Lord Henry's words and decides that he wants to live a life of hedonism. Basil tries to warn Dorian about the dangers of giving into temptation, but Dorian doesn't listen. He makes a wish that the portrait Basil painted of him would age instead of him. As Dorian indulges in a life of excess, the portrait hidden away in his attic gradually changes to reflect his corrupted soul. Dorian remains young and handsome, while the portrait becomes a hideous monster. One day, Dorian's conscience finally catches up with him and he realizes the error of his ways.

In the end, Dorian is killed by the portrait and his soul is trapped inside of it forever.\n\nStory so far: The passage discusses the uselessness of art, how it is only excusable if the artist admires it intensely, and how it is often seen as a form of autobiography.

The mind of a well-informed person is like a bric-a-brac shop, full of dust and monsters, the author says. They think that their friend has changed and become less attractive to them. The painter Basil Hallward tells his friend Lord Henry Wotton that he does not want him to meet Dorian Gray, as he is the only person who gives his art whatever charm it possesses. Dorian Gray is sitting at a piano, turning the pages of a book of music. He tells his friend Basil that he wants to learn the piece, and Basil says it depends on how Dorian sits. Dorian says he is tired of sitting and does not want a life-sized portrait of himself. When he sees Lord Henry, he blushes and starts to get up. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he is one of Lady Agatha's favorites, and Dorian says he is in her black books at the moment. Lord Henry tells Dorian that he will make peace with Lady Agatha.

There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth\u2019s passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world.

Through their experiences, Hester and those around her learn the value of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to overcome even the harshest of circumstances.\n\nStory so far: The passage reflects on the author's observations of history, morality, and the human condition. He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The passage describes the retirement of several older customs officers, who were allowed to leave their posts due to their age and infirmity. The author suggests that their retirement may have been due to his own interference, and notes that neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise. The passage describes a building with a large American eagle on it. The eagle looks threatening, but many people still seek shelter under its wing.\n\nLast chunk: barbed arrows in each claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, careful of their safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she has no great tenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,\u2014oftener soon than late,\u2014is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows.  The pavement round about the above-described edifice\u2014which we may as well name at once as the Custom-House of the port\u2014has grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn by any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by itself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their ventures go to swell,\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at New York or Boston.

It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.  Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.

Upon his release, he is reunited with his daughter Lucie, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. Together, they move to London to rebuild their lives, where they become acquainted with Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry. Sydney Carton, a brilliant but disillusioned lawyer, bears a striking resemblance to Darnay. Despite his feelings for Lucie, he recognizes that she loves Darnay and resigns himself to a life of unrequited love. Carton becomes a close friend of the Manette and Darnay families, vowing to protect them at all costs. As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy. Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine.

Publicly shamed and ostracized, Hester is forced to confront her new reality and find ways to survive in a society that views her as a moral outcast.Unknown to the townspeople, Hester's husband, Roger Chillingworth, arrives in Boston under an assumed name, seeking revenge on the man who had an affair with his wife. As Chillingworth insinuates himself into the town's power structure, he becomes obsessed with discovering the identity of Hester's lover and exacting his revenge.Meanwhile, Hester gives birth to a daughter named Pearl, the product of her adulterous relationship. As a single mother, Hester faces numerous challenges raising Pearl, who grows up to be a fiercely independent and headstrong child, often clashing with the rigid norms of Puritan society.As the years pass, Hester's strength, resilience, and good deeds slowly begin to change the minds of the townspeople. They come to see her as a symbol of redemption and forgiveness, and the once-hated scarlet letter becomes a mark of honor in their eyes.In the midst of these changes, Hester's former lover, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, is revealed as the father of Pearl. Consumed by guilt and his secret love for Hester, Dimmesdale's health deteriorates, and he eventually confesses his sin to the town.With Dimmesdale's confession, Chillingworth's plan for revenge is thwarted, and he soon dies, consumed by his own hatred and bitterness. Hester and Pearl leave Boston for a time but eventually return, with Hester continuing to wear the scarlet letter as a symbol of her past and her ability to overcome adversity.Years later, Hester is able to find happiness with a new husband, and Pearl grows up to have a successful life of her own.

The brave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his threescore years and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march, burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit-stirring recollections could do little towards lightening. The step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge. It was only with the assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascend the Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace. There he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went; amid the rustle of papers, the administering of oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual talk of the office; all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation.

It was not painful to behold this look; for, though dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. The framework of his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin.  To observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may remain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of peace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.

Charles Darnay, born into French nobility as Charles St. Evr\u00e9monde, renounces his title and flees to England to escape the oppressive regime of pre-revolutionary France. He is accused of treason in England but is acquitted due to Carton's skillful defense. Darnay falls in love with Lucie Manette, and they eventually marry.

As the French Revolution erupts, Darnay returns to Paris to help a former servant in danger, only to be arrested himself by revolutionaries seeking revenge on the aristocracy.

Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced.

Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Carton follow Darnay to Paris in a desperate attempt to save him from the guillotine. The novel culminates in a thrilling climax, as Carton makes the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and happiness of those he loves.

He describes how he interacted with old sailors, Hester Prynne's public punishment for adultery, and a dying man's final moments. The author reflects on their failed attempt to write a historical novel, and how it was perhaps a foolish endeavor. The passage also discusses the effect of a minister's voice on the listener, regardless of the language spoken. The General was a man who was known for his grace and beauty, and he was also fond of flowers. He was often seen sitting by the fireplace, and the Surveyor would watch him from a distance. Although the General was always nearby, he seemed unattainable.\n\nLast chunk: his brow; but here was one who seemed to have a young girl\u2019s appreciation of the floral tribe.  There, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; while the Surveyor\u2014though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation\u2014was fond of standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him but a few yards off; remote, though we passed close beside his chair; unattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the Collector\u2019s office. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the battle; the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years before;\u2014such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his intellectual sense. Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of this commercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmur round about him; and neither with the men nor their affairs did the General appear to sustain the most distant relation. He was as much out of place as an old sword\u2014now rusty, but which had flashed once in the battle\u2019s front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade\u2014would have been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on the Deputy Collector\u2019s desk.  There was one thing that much\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": "aided me in renewing and re-creating the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,\u2014the man of true and simple energy.

If, in our country, valor were rewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase\u2014which it seems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and glory before him, has ever spoken\u2014would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the General\u2019s shield of arms.  It contributes greatly towards a man\u2019s moral and intellectual health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office. There was one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of business; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish, as by the waving of an enchanter\u2019s wand.
