[[INPUT/PROMPT]]

        Story Outline: *?numbered list*?
        <<outline>>

        Where are we in the story?
        <<summary of where we are>>

        Last chunk:
        <<last paragraph(s)>> This may be multiple paragraphs - the scarcity of the token is the pain point

        Next Chunk: [[END]]

[[OUTPUT/COMPLETION]] ** You need to play in the playground to understand how AMAZING AND NOVEL this part is
<<next paragraph or two of the story>>

We want to see if we can get it to spit out one part of the story at a time

**Need to write a couple scripts to do the data prep to achieve the above**
