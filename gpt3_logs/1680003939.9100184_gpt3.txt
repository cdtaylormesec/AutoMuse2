Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: a pistol.  Sink the ship? cried Steelkilt. Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men? turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.  The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:Its not our fault; we didnt want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boys business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; dont be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and were your men; but we wont be flogged.  Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!  Look ye, now, cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, dye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we dont want a row; its not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we wont be flogged.  Turn to! roared the Captain.  Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we wont lift a hand against ye

RESPONSE:

The sailors on the ship are disgruntled and don't want to work anymore because the captain has been mistreating them. They threaten to mutiny unless the captain agrees to treat them better.
