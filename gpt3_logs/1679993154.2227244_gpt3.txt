The Pool of Tears   Curiouser and curiouser! cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); now Im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet! (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Im sure _I_ shant be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;but I must be kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they wont walk the way I want to go! Let me see: Ill give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. They must go by the carrier, she thought; and how funny itll seem, sending presents to ones own feet! And how odd the directions will look!       _Alices Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with      Alices love_).  Oh dear, what nonsense Im talking!  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.  Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless

RESPONSE:

Alice grows very tall and plans to send presents to her feet. She bangs her head and decides it is hopeless to try and get into the garden.
