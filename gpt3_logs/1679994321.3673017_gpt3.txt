PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: repeat something now. Tell her to begin. He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.  Stand up and repeat _Tis the voice of the sluggard_, said the Gryphon.  How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons! thought Alice; I might as well be at school at once. However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:  Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair. As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.  [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]   Thats different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child, said the Gryphon.  Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle; but it sounds uncommon nonsense.  Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.  I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.  She cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily. Go on with the next verse.  But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted. How _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?
