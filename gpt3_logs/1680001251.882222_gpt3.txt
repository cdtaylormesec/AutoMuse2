Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: Abruptly he slammed the door.  My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all.  Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.  Going away? I inquired.  No, old sport.  I hear you fired all your servants.  I wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip. Daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons.  So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.  Theyre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. Theyre all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.  I see.  He was calling up at Daisys requestwould I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.  The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car
