Passage: know your name at the theatre? If they dont, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an important point.  Dorian did not answer for a few moments.

She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I dont know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.  Harry, Harry, it is terrible! cried the lad.  Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustnt let this thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come
