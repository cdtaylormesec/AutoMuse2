PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. All right, says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.  Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but dont you, so help me, move outside this room.  It was four oclock in the morning then, and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight.  Did he go? I asked innocently.  Sure he went. Mr. Wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly. He turned around in the door and says: Dont let that waiter take away my coffee! Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.  Four of them were electrocuted, I said, remembering.  Five, with Becker. His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. I understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion.  The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:  Oh, no, he exclaimed, this isnt the man.  No? Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.  This is just a friend. I told you wed talk about that some other time.  I beg your pardon, said Mr. Wolfshiem, I had a wrong man.  A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around

RESPONSE:

In the early morning hours, six people are sitting around a table at a restaurant, drinking and eating. The waiter comes up to one of the men, Rosy Rosenthal, and tells him that someone wants to speak to him outside. Rosenthal starts to get up, but the narrator grabs him and pulls him back down, telling him not to go outside. Rosenthal leaves anyway, and is shot three times in the stomach. Four of the men responsible for his death are later electrocuted, and the narrator tells Mr. Wolfshiem, who is interested in doing business with him, that he is not the man he is looking for.
