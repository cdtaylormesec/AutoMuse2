Passage: The phone rings and I'm out of bed in a flash. I'm not answering it, but I can't help but be curious. I slump into a chair by the window, wondering if I should answer. I punch the speaker button and a voice comes through.

"Detective Whisper."

"It's me."

"What do you want?"

"I need you to find someone for me."

"A missing persons case?"

"No, this is bigger than that. I need you to find a killer."

"You got it."

"I'm going to send you the details."

"Give me a few minutes."

I check my email, downloading the attached file. I open it, reading through the case details. I feel my heart sink and my palms start sweating. This is going to be a tough one.

I need to find a killer before they do it again.
