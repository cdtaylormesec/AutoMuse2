Passage: herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead!     CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as its asleep, I suppose it doesnt mind.  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: No room! No room! they cried out when they saw Alice coming. Theres _plenty_ of room! said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.  Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. I dont see any wine, she remarked.  There isnt any, said the March Hare.  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.  I didnt know it was _your_ table, said Alice; its laid for a great many more than three.  Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.  You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity; its very rude.
