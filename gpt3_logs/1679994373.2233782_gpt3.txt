Passage: from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated       with dismay all the consequent explanations.        She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat       down. He then said,        I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me       exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to       know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_       daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a       very important conquest.        The colour now rushed into Elizabeths cheeks in the       instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,       instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be       pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his       letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father       continued:        You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such       matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to       discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.       Collins.        From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?        Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with       congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest       daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the       good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your       impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates       to yourself, is as follows:
