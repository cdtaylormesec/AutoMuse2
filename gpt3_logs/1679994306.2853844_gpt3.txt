Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet. The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.  Theres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for two reasons. First, because Im on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you. And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
