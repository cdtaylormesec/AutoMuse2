RESPONSE:

The author observes that the sense of touch seems to be concentrated in the tail of a whale, and that this delicacy is most evident in the way the whale gently sweeps its flukes from side to side.

The author then describes how, despite the whale's enormous size, it can play in the ocean like a kitten. Finally, the author describes how the whale's tail can create a loud noise when it smacks the water.
