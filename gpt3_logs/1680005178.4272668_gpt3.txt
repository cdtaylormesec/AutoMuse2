The townspeople are both fascinated and repelled by the scarlet letter A that Hester is wearing.

The minister has a library in his room, filled with books from various religious traditions. The health of Mr. Dimmesdale, a religious leader in New England, is failing.

However, Mr. Dimmesdale himself believes that if he is going to die, it is because Providence has willed it. The passage describes how the clergyman's reserve thwarted the schemer's plans, but he is content with how things have turned out nonetheless. Providence has given him a revelation, and he now has power over the clergyman's soul.
