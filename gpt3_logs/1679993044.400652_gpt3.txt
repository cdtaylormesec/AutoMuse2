PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: fortunate lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbells suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.  What do you think has happened to Basil? asked Dorian, holding up his Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly.  I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine. If he is dead, I dont want to think about him. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.  Why? said the younger man wearily.  Because, said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, one can survive everything nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her.
