PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.  I have it, I have it, cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in the subterranean regions, a purse! a purse!  Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahabs loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.   CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.  Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct.

RESPONSE:

Ambergris is a substance that is found in the intestines of sperm whales. It is used in perfumes and is worth a lot of money. In 1791, a man was questioned about it in the English House of Commons.
