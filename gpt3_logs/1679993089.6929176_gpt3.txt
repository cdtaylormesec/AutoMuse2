PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: pause. Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me sothe coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.  And shall I nail down the lid, sir? moving his hand as with a hammer.  Aye.  And shall I caulk the seams, sir? moving his hand as with a caulking-iron.  Aye.  And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir? moving his hand as with a pitch-pot.  Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no more.Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.  He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I dont like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he wont put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now Im ordered to make a life-buoy of it. Its like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I dont like this cobbling sort of businessI dont like it at all; its undignified; its not my place. Let tinkers brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobblers job, thats at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. Its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran
