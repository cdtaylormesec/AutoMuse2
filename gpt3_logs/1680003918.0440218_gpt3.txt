PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: up the walk.  Then he looked at Lord Henry. Dorian Gray is my dearest friend, he said. He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Dont spoil him. Dont try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Dont take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you. He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.  What nonsense you talk! said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.     CHAPTER II.   As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumanns Forest Scenes. You must lend me these, Basil, he cried. I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming.  That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.  Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I dont want a life-sized portrait of myself, answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didnt know you had any one with you.  This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything.

Concise Summary:

RESPONSE:

Dorian Gray is Basil Hallward's friend, and Lord Henry Wotton is an old friend of Hallward's from Oxford. Hallward tells Wotton not to influence Gray, because Gray is important to his art. Gray then enters and says he doesn't want his portrait today.
