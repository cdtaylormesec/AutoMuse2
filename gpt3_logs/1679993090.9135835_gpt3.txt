Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: and you dont get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you dont get it (_sneezes_). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and lets have that ferule and buckle-screw; Ill be ready for them presently. Lucky now (_sneezes_) theres no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (_sneezes_) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs Ive seen in shop windows wouldnt compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (_sneezes_) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! thats the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or its somebody else, thats certain.  AHAB (_advancing_). (_During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues sneezing at times._)  Well, manmaker!  Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me measure, sir.  Measured for a leg! good. Well, its not the first time. About it! There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.  Oh, sir, it will break bonesbeware, beware!  No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
