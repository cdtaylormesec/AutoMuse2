PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?  Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!  I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.  Indeed, my own? Why so?  That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.  If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?  I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.  It is a painful reflection to me, said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this of him.  My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.  She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.  And, O my dearest Love! she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!
