PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile, she said:        I did not know before that you ever walked this way.        I have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as I       generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at       the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?        No, I should have turned in a moment.        And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the       Parsonage together.        Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday? said she.        Yesif Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his       disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.        And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at       least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know       anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes       than Mr. Darcy.        He likes to have his own way very well, replied Colonel       Fitzwilliam. But so we all do. It is only that he has better       means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many       others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must       be inured to self-denial and dependence.        In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little       of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial       and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money       from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a       fancy for?
