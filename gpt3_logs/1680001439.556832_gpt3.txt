Summarize this passage very concisely:

Ill be judge, Ill be jury, Said cunning old Fury: Ill          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.  You are not attending! said the Mouse to Alice severely. What are you thinking of?  I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly: you had got to the fifth bend, I think?  I had _not!_ cried the Mouse, sharply

RESPONSE:

The mouse tells Alice its history, and why it hates creatures C and D. Alice is only half-listening, and her understanding of the story is skewed.
