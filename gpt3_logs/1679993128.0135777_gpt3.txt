PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.  Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in?  There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on without attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he cant help it, she said to herself; his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.How am I to get in? she repeated, aloud.  I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footmans head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.  or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.  How am I to get in? asked Alice again, in a louder tone.  _Are_ you to get in at all? said the Footman. Thats the first question, you know.  It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. Its really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue. Its enough to drive one crazy!  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for days and days.  But what am _I_ to do? said Alice.

RESPONSE:

Alice is trying to figure out how to get into the house, and the Footman tells her that she might as well not bother because he's just going to sit there and do nothing. Alice gets frustrated and mutters to herself that all the creatures in this place are driving her crazy.
