Passage: but unable to waste such a precious       occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, Come here,       my love, I want to speak to you, took her out of the room. Jane       instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at       such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in       to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and       called out:        Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.        Elizabeth was forced to go.        We may as well leave them by themselves you know; said her       mother, as soon as she was in the hall. Kitty and I are going up       stairs to sit in my dressing-room.        Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained       quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then       returned into the drawing-room.        Mrs. Bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was       every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her       daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged       officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter.        He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he       went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and       Mrs. Bennets means, for his coming next morning
