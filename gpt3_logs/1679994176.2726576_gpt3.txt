RESPONSE:

This passage describes the narrator's experiences with heavily scented oils and burning gums from the East. He observes that there is a correlation between the moods of the mind and the sensuous life, and sets out to discover the true relations between them. He wonders what it is about frankincense that makes one mystical, for example, and musk that troubles the brain. He also experiments with different scents to see how they affect the imagination. At another time, he devoted himself entirely to music, and held concerts in which mad gipsies, Tunisians, and Negroes played various instruments. The harsh intervals and discords of the music sometimes stirred the narrator in ways that more traditional music could not.
