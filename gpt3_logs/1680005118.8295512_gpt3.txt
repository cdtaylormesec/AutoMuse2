Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: Governor Bellingham finds Hester Prynne's daughter, Pearl, in the hall and is surprised by her appearance. Mr. Wilson asks Pearl who she is and if she is a Christian. The passage describes the author's interactions with old, experienced sailors who continued to work at the docks even though they were well past retirement age. The author knew that they should have been replaced by younger, more fit men, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. The sailors eventually came to accept the author and they would often tell each other stories and jokes. The passage describes a person finding an old document in a graveyard. The document is a commission from Governor Shirley to Jonathan Pue, appointing him Surveyor of Customs in Salem. The person remembers reading about Pue's death and the digging up of his remains, and notes that only a skeleton and some fragments of clothing were all that remained of him. Hester Prynne's appearance had changed drastically since she committed adultery and she was no longer seen as a desirable woman. Some attribute this to the fact that she had experienced a great deal of hardship, which had changed her personality. It is possible for her to become a desirable woman again, but it would require a special touch. The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale is about to confess his sin to the people of Boston from the scaffold, supported by Hester Prynne and holding the hand of her daughter, Pearl. He says that he knows this is better than what they dreamed of in the forest. Hester replies that she does not know if it is better or not, but the minister says that it is as God has willed it.
