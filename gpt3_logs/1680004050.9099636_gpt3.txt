Passage: had all the masters that were necessary.       Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.        Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if       I had known your mother, I should have advised her most       strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be       done in education without steady and regular instruction, and       nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many       families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am       always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of       Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;       and it was but the other day that I recommended another young       person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the       family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you       of Lady Metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss       Pope a treasure. Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a       treasure. Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?        Yes, maam, all.        All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the       second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!       Your younger sisters must be very young?        Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to       be much in company. But really, maam, I think it would be very       hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share       of society
