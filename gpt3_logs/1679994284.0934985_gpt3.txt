PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: everybody minding their own business!  Ah, well! It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added, and the moral of _that_ isTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.  How fond she is of finding morals in things! Alice thought to herself.  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your waist, the Duchess said after a pause: the reason is, that Im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?  He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.  Very true, said the Duchess: flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together.  Only mustard isnt a bird, Alice remarked.  Right, as usual, said the Duchess: what a clear way you have of putting things!  Its a mineral, I _think_, said Alice.  Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; theres a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that isThe more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.  Oh, I know! exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, its a vegetable. It doesnt look like one, but it is.  I quite agree with you, said the Duchess; and the moral of that isBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
