Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: with a space between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yet one tombstone served for both. All around, there were monuments carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab of slateas the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex himself with the purportthere appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon. It bore a device, a heralds wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; so sombre is it, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow:                 ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES.
